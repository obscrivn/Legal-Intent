0,"Our analysis begins with a dim view of indemnity clauses like the one at issue here. At one time, Indiana flatly prohibited at least some contracts for indemnity against a partyíëŒs own negligence.  See, e.g., Freigy v. Gargaro Co., 223 Ind. 342, 352, 60 N.E.2d 288, 292 ; Penn. R. Co. v. Kent, 136 Ind. App. 551, 560, 198 N.E.2d 615, 619  ). We later retreated from that prohibition and now generally allow parties, as a matter of freedom of contract, íëŒ±to allocate risk by contractíëŒÂŒŠí__including by agreeing to íëŒ±indemnification for oneíëŒs own negligence.íëŒÂ Fresh Cut, Inc. v. Fazli, 650 N.E.2d 1126, 1130  ). Even so, indemnity provisions are strictly con-struedŒŠí__we treat them as íëŒ±disfavor[ed] . . . because we are mindful that to obligate one party to pay for the negligence of another is a harsh burden that no party would lightly accept.íëŒÂ Henthorne v. Legacy Healthcare, Inc., 764 N.E.2d 751, 757 . Accordingly, indemnity is permissible only if the contract language shows in íëŒ±clear and unequivocal termsíëŒÂ that the obligated party íëŒ±knowingly and willingly agrees to such indemnification.íëŒÂ Id.",2a,1b,174,174
1,"Moreover, our courts have generally taken for granted that the parties would be bargaining about prospective liability, by referring to íëŒ±future acts of negligenceíëŒÂ or making the agreement íëŒ±in advance.íëŒÂ E.g., Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 578 N.E.2d at 670 ; Powell v. Am. Health Fitness Ctr. of Fort Wayne, Inc., 694 N.E.2d 757, 760   )). That assumptionŒŠí__that parties would bargain over only prospective liabilityŒŠí__is rooted in the very nature of allocating risk.",2c,1b,70,244
2,"One context in which Indiana has recognized that assumption is the íëŒ±known lossíëŒÂ doctrine in insurance lawŒŠí__which embodies the commonsense principle that a party cannot íëŒ±insureíëŒÂ against a loss that has already happened, because there is no íëŒ±riskíëŒÂ left to be allocated:  The íëŒ±known lossíëŒÂ doctrine is a common law concept deriving from the fundamental requirement in insurance law that the loss be fortuitous. Simply put, the known loss doctrine states that one may not obtain insurance for a loss that has already taken place. Describing the known loss doctrine, commentators have noted that losses which exist at the time of the insuring agreement, or which are so probable or imminent that there is insufficient íëŒ±riskíëŒÂ being transferred between the insured and insurer, are not proper subjects of insurance.  . . .  . . . [W]e hold that if an insured has actual knowledge that a loss has occurred, is occurring, or is substantially certain to occur on or before the effective date of the policy, the known loss doctrine will bar coverage. This is not to say, however, that parties may not explicitly agree to cover existing losses. Indeed, the known loss doctrine is inapplicable if the insurer also knew of the circumstances on which it bases the defense.  Gen. Housewares Corp. v. NatíëŒl Sur. Corp., 741 N.E.2d 408, 413_14   ).",2b,1a,215,459
3,"The basic rationale of the known-loss rule applies with equal force in the context of this non-insurance indemnity provision. If a potential future liability íëŒ±is a harsh burden that a party would not lightly accept,íëŒÂ GKN Co. v. Starnes Trucking, Inc., 798 N.E.2d 548, 552 , then actual retroactive liability for a known loss is harsher stillŒŠí__indeed, it would ordinarily be a foolíëŒs bargain. íëŒ±This is not to say, however, that parties may not explicitly agree to cover existing losses,íëŒÂ Gen. Housewares, 741 N.E.2d at 414 ŒŠí__that is, íëŒ±in clear and unequivocal terms,íëŒÂ to be strictly construed. GKN Co., 798 N.E.2d at 552. But Indiana law makes clear that we will not infer a partyíëŒs agreement to such an onerous liability unless that intent is expressed unmistakably.",2b,1b,126,585
4,"Though Indiana contract law suggests a particularly strong disfavor for retroactive indemnity provisions as discussed above, we have never squarely addressed the retroactivity question. Nine other jurisdictions, however, have similarly concluded that such an extraordinary obligation as retro-active indemnity must be expressed unmistakably. Georgia states the rule particularly emphatically, requiring agreements for retroactive indemnity to be stated íëŒ±expressly, plainly, clearly, and unequi-vocallyíëŒÂ to be valid. Service Merch. Co. v. Hunter Fan Co., 617 S.E.2d 235, 240 .  Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, and New York declare similar standards, requiring such provisions to be completely unambiguous. Fina, Inc. v. ARCO, 200 F.3d 266, 273  ; Chicago & N.W. Transp. Co. v. Emmet Fertilizer & Grain Co., 852 F.2d 358, 360  ; Servco Pac. Inc. v. Dods, 193 F. Supp. 2d 1183, 1193  ; DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Wesco Distribution, Inc., 760 N.W.2d 828, 833  ); Quality King Distribs., Inc. v. E & M ESR, Inc., 827 N.Y.S.2d 700, 703  ); Evans v. Howard R. Green Co., 231 N.W.2d 907, 916_17  , p. 581)). And Maryland and Pennsylvania simply take for grantedŒŠí__seemingly as too obvious for analysisŒŠí__that indemnity clauses cannot apply to liabilities that predate the contract. See Bunker Ramo-Eltra Corp. v. Fairchild Indus., 639 F. Supp. 409, 419  ; Werner v. Big Sky Shop, 630 F. Supp. 444, 451  .",2a,1b,206,791
5,"Each of these decisions is consistent with IndianaíëŒs requirement of íëŒ±clear and unequivocalíëŒÂ languageŒŠí__construing such provisions strictly, as New York has explained, íëŒ±to avoid reading into them duties which the parties did not intend to be assumed.íëŒÂ Quality King, 827 N.Y.S.2d at 702. But two cases, one from Michigan and one from Iowa, are particularly analogous, because they involve indemnity language contained in routine, standard-form documents exchanged after an accident.  ",1a,1b,70,861
6,"In DaimlerChrysler, a Wesco employee was hurt while preparing a quote for electrical repair work at a DaimlerChrysler  plant. 760 N.W.2d at 830. After the accident, DC issued Wesco a purchase order for the quoted work, with language requiring Wesco to indemnify DC for losses íëŒ±arising out of or related to the performance of any work in connection with this contract.íëŒÂ Id. at 830_31. The court held that the language of the post-accident purchase order did not show an intent to indemnify for pre-contract losses:  It is one thing to decide whether an injury occurring during the term of the contract falls within the contractíëŒs coverage language, but it is quite another to decide whether a party has agreed to indemnify another for an injury that occurred before the indemnity provision was agreed upon. Hence, . . . we must look to whether the parties provided language that shows an intent to require indemnification for precontract activity.  Id. at 834. Finding no such terms in the purchase order, the court held Wesco had no obligation to indemnify DC for losses in connection with the pre-contract accident. Id.",1a,1a,184,1045
7,"Similarly, in Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Estate of Lartius, an employer rented a crane for a day, and his employee was injured while using it. No. 06-1725, 2007 WL 3087505, at *1 .3 Twelve days later, the employer rented another crane from the same company, and when he returned it, he paid both daysíëŒ rental fees and initialed a íëŒ±work orderíëŒÂ for both days that contained small-print indemnity language on the front. Id. The employer did not read the work order before initialing it, even though all parties were aware of the employeeíëŒs injury. Id. Even though the employeríëŒs failure to read the work order did not make its terms unenforceable, the terms themselves could not be construed to impose retroactive liability because the contract language did not íëŒ±specifically provide[] for . . . indemnification of Crane RentalíëŒs prior losses or liabilitiesíëŒÂ and therefore was íëŒ±not sufficient to meet the plain and manifest intent requirement of Evans.íëŒÂ Id. at *3_*4 .",2,1a,158,1203
8,"Bearing in mind the skepticism with which Indiana and other states view alleged agreements to indemnify retroactively for known losses, we now turn to Mid-AmericaíëŒs contention that it reached such an agreement with the Commission through a long-running course of dealing.",1c,3a,41,1244
9,"Though none of the indemnity language in this invoice expressly extends to losses prior to the invoice date, Mid-America argues that its course of dealing with the Commission established such an agreementŒŠí__or at least raises a question of fact of whether such an agreement existed. Again, the parties stopped exchanging contracts before the Fair in 2002 and began using claim vouchers and invoices after the FairŒŠí__and then, starting in 2003, the invoices included the same indemnity lan-guage at issue here.  And the claim vouchers, which the Commission signed and submitted for payment, certified that the attached in-voicesŒŠí__including the indemnity language they containedŒŠí__were íëŒ±in accordance with [the] contract.íëŒÂ",1a,1c,107,1351
10,"In essence, Mid-America argues that under this course of dealing, the invoicesíëŒ indemnity language is not being applied retroactively. Instead, it asserts that the invoices memorialized a standing recognition from each previous yearíëŒs dealings that the following yearíëŒs rental would be subject to the same indemnification requirements. But the Eighth Circuit, applying Nebraska law, rejected a similar argument in Emmet Fertilizer, 852 F.2d at 359_60. There, Emmet had installed a fertilizer unloader at a railroadíëŒs facility in 1977. Id. at 359. Then in 1978, an Emmet employee was badly hurt while operating the unloader and later settled a negligence claim against the railroad for his injuries. Id. The railroad then sought indemnification from Emmet based on indemnity language in a 1981 license agreement for the unloader. Id. The Emmet Court first observed that the license did not unambiguously provide for retroactive effect, and that íëŒ±[i]f the parties had intended EmmetíëŒs indemnity obligation to extend to past accidents, they could easily have designed the language . . . to say exactly that.íëŒÂ Id. at 360.",1a,1c 1a,171,[1352-1369][1370-1522]
11,"The Court then rejected an argument much like the course-of-dealing claim Mid-America makes hereŒŠí__that Emmet knew its installation would be subject to the indemnity provisions of the railroadíëŒs íëŒ±standard license agreement,íëŒÂ which Emmet had signed twice before as part of similar installations:  [The railroad] presents an alternate theory of recoveryŒŠí__that Emmet had orally agreed as early as 1976 to maintain its fertilizer unloader subject to [the railroadíëŒs] íëŒ±standard license agreement.íëŒÂ Emmet had previously signed two license agreements covering facilities similar to the fertilizer unloader, each of which contained an indemnity provision. [The railroad] reasons that the indemnity clauses of these earlier licenses were incorporated by reference into an implied oral agreement governing the fertilizer unloader from 1976 onward.  Id. But the Court refused to rely on that course of dealing íëŒ±to infer the existence of a type of obliga-tion that is not favored in Nebraska courtsíëŒÂ in the absence of íëŒ±clear and unequivocal languageíëŒÂŒŠí__specifically noting that íëŒ±Nebraska law requires specific proof of the indemnitoríëŒs intent to be bound by such an extraordinary obligation.íëŒÂ Id. .",3,1a,174,1696
12,"We reach the same conclusion here, for the same reasons. As we have explained, Indiana law likewise requires a íëŒ±clear and unequivocalíëŒÂ expression of a íëŒ±knowing[] and willing[]íëŒÂ agreement to indemnify a party for its own negligence, GKN Co., 798 N.E.2d at 552ŒŠí__and moreover, to say so íëŒ±explicitlyíëŒÂ if they further intend that liability íëŒ±to cover existing losses,íëŒÂ Gen. Housewares, 741 N.E.2d at 414. Even accepting all of Mid-AmericaíëŒs evidence as true for purposes of summary judgment, see Hughley, 15 N.E.3d at 1003, the partiesíëŒ course of dealing cannot substitute for a íëŒ±clear and unequivocalíëŒÂ indication in the contract itself that the Commission íëŒ±knowingly and willinglyíëŒÂ agreed to indemnify Mid-America for its own negligence in connection with a cata-strophic loss that had already happened. See GKN Co., 798 N.E.2d at 552.",1a,1c,131,1827
13,"Mid-AmericaíëŒs reliance on Southern Railway Company v. Arlen Realty & Development Corp., a Virginia case taking the opposite view, is misplaced. 257 S.E.2d 841 . There, Arlen leased trailers from the railroad for several years, usually executing the lease agreements after picking up the trailers. Id. at 842. An Arlen employee sued the railroad after being injured while picking up a trailer. Id. at 842_43. The railroad pursued Arlen based on indemnity language in the lease agreements, but Arlen argued the language was not binding because the lease was not signed until after the employeeíëŒs accident. Id. at 843, 845. The court disagreed, íëŒ±finding that the parties, by their course of dealings, had assented to and adopted the terms of the printed form as their agreement . . . in hundreds of transactions between the parties over a period of several years precedingíëŒÂ the employeeíëŒs injury. Id. at 845. But Virginia is an outlier in that it treats indemnity agreements just like any other contract. See Carpenter Insulation & Coatings Co. v. Statewide Sheet Metal & Roofing Corp., 937 F.2d 602, *3   . And, in more than 35 years, Arlen has been cited on this course-of-dealing issue only onceŒŠí__by the Court of AppealsíëŒ now-vacated decision in this case. Mid-America points to no other similar holding, and we find none. We therefore decline to follow Arlen, which represents a minority view based on different contract-law principles.",3,1a 1c,227,[1828-1848][1849-2054]
14,"In summary, then, the principle we deduce from Indiana contract law  is this: Indemnification for another partyíëŒs negligenceŒŠí__especially retroactivelyŒŠí__is an íëŒ±extraordinary obligationíëŒÂ that is generally íëŒ±not favored.íëŒÂ Emmet Fertilizer, 852 F.2d at 360. Accordingly, as a matter of law, we will not infer that obligation from a course of dealing when, as here, the partiesíëŒ contract does not expressly call for it in íëŒ±clear and unequivocal terms.íëŒÂ GKN Co., 798 N.E.2d at 552. The trial court therefore correctly granted summary judgment for the Commission and against Mid-America.",3,3a,87,2141
15,"In view of that conclusion, we express no opinion on whether the Commission is a govern-mental entity with immunity under the Indiana Tort Claims Act , Ind. Code ch. 34-13-3; whether indemnity for another partyíëŒs negligence is a tort- or contract-based liability for ITCA purposes; or whether the invoicesíëŒ indemnity language is void against public policy. But those arguments do illustrate why Mid-AmericaíëŒs failure to make a íëŒ±clear and unequivocalíëŒÂ demand for retroactive indemnification is particularly significant in these circumstances. Regardless of their merits, those claims are not implausibleŒŠí__and therefore it seems that a party seeking to impose such a disfavored liability under these circumstances would have particular incentive to draft its contract in the clearest and most unequivocal terms possible. Mid-AmericaíëŒs failure to do so here further underscores why we should not infer an extraordinary liability when a contract fails to provide for it expressly.",3,3b,145,2286
