<body>Our analysis begins with a dim view of indemnity clauses like the one at issue here . At one time , Indiana flatly prohibited at least some contracts for indemnity against a party's own negligence . See , e.g. , Freigy v. Gargaro Co. , 223 Ind . 342 , 352 , 60 N.E.2d 288 , 292 ; Penn . R. Co. v. Kent , 136 Ind . App . 551 , 560 , 198 N.E.2d 615 , 619 ) . We later retreated from that prohibition and now generally allow parties , as a matter of freedom of contract , "to allocate risk by contract"-including by agreeing to "indemnification for one's own negligence." Fresh Cut , Inc. v. Fazli , 650 N.E.2d 1126 , 1130 ) . Even so , indemnity provisions are strictly con-strued-we treat them as "disfavor [ ed ] . . . because we are mindful that to obligate one party to pay for the negligence of another is a harsh burden that no party would lightly accept." Henthorne v. Legacy Healthcare , Inc. , 764 N.E.2d 751 , 757 . Accordingly , indemnity is permissible only if the contract language shows in "clear and unequivocal terms" that the obligated party "knowingly and willingly agrees to such indemnification." Id . Moreover , our courts have generally taken for granted that the parties would be bargaining about prospective liability , by referring to "future acts of negligence" or making the agreement "in advance." E.g. , Indianapolis Power and Light Co. , 578 N.E.2d at 670 ; Powell v. Am . Health Fitness Ctr . of Fort Wayne , Inc. , 694 N.E.2d 757 , 760 ) ) . That assumption-that parties would bargain over only prospective liability-is rooted in the very nature of allocating risk . One context in which Indiana has recognized that assumption is the "known loss" doctrine in insurance law-which embodies the commonsense principle that a party can not "insure" against a loss that has already happened , because there is no "risk" left to be allocated : The "known loss" doctrine is a common law concept deriving from the fundamental requirement in insurance law that the loss be fortuitous . Simply put , the known loss doctrine states that one may not obtain insurance for a loss that has already taken place . Describing the known loss doctrine , commentators have noted that losses which exist at the time of the insuring agreement , or which are so probable or imminent that there is insufficient "risk" being transferred between the insured and insurer , are not proper subjects of insurance . . . . . . . [ W ] e hold that if an insured has actual knowledge that a loss has occurred , is occurring , or is substantially certain to occur on or before the effective date of the policy , the known loss doctrine will bar coverage . This is not to say , however , that parties may not explicitly agree to cover existing losses . Indeed , the known loss doctrine is inapplicable if the insurer also knew of the circumstances on which it bases the defense . Gen . Housewares Corp. v. Nat'l Sur . Corp. , 741 N.E.2d 408 , 413_14 ) . The basic rationale of the known-loss rule applies with equal force in the context of this non-insurance indemnity provision . If a potential future liability "is a harsh burden that a party would not lightly accept , " GKN Co. v. Starnes Trucking , Inc. , 798 N.E.2d 548 , 552 , then actual retroactive liability for a known loss is harsher still-indeed , it would ordinarily be a fool's bargain . "This is not to say , however , that parties may not explicitly agree to cover existing losses , " Gen . Housewares , 741 N.E.2d at 414 -that is , "in clear and unequivocal terms , " to be strictly construed . GKN Co. , 798 N.E.2d at 552 . But Indiana law makes clear that we will not infer a party's agreement to such an onerous liability unless that intent is expressed unmistakably . Though Indiana contract law suggests a particularly strong disfavor for retroactive indemnity provisions as discussed above , we have never squarely addressed the retroactivity question . Nine other jurisdictions , however , have similarly concluded that such an extraordinary obligation as retro-active indemnity must be expressed unmistakably . Georgia states the rule particularly emphatically , requiring agreements for retroactive indemnity to be stated "expressly , plainly , clearly , and unequi-vocally" to be valid . Service Merch . Co. v. Hunter Fan Co. , 617 S.E.2d 235 , 240 . Delaware , Hawaii , Iowa , Michigan , Nebraska , and New York declare similar standards , requiring such provisions to be completely unambiguous . Fina , Inc. v. ARCO , 200 F.3d 266 , 273 ; Chicago and N.W . Transp . Co. v. Emmet Fertilizer and Grain Co. , 852 F.2d 358 , 360 ; Servco Pac . Inc. v. Dods , 193 F. Supp . 2d 1183 , 1193 ; DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Wesco Distribution , Inc. , 760 N.W.2d 828 , 833 ) ; Quality King Distribs. , Inc. v. E and M ESR , Inc. , 827 N.Y.S.2d 700 , 703 ) ; Evans v. Howard R. Green Co. , 231 N.W.2d 907 , 916_17 , p. 581 ) ) . And Maryland and Pennsylvania simply take for granted-seemingly as too obvious for analysis-that indemnity clauses can not apply to liabilities that predate the contract . See Bunker Ramo-Eltra Corp. v. Fairchild Indus. , 639 F. Supp . 409 , 419 ; Werner v. Big Sky Shop , 630 F. Supp . 444 , 451 . Each of these decisions is consistent with Indiana's requirement of "clear and unequivocal" language-construing such provisions strictly , as New York has explained , "to avoid reading into them duties which the parties did not intend to be assumed." Quality King , 827 N.Y.S.2d at 702 . But two cases , one from Michigan and one from Iowa , are particularly analogous , because they involve indemnity language contained in routine , standard-form documents exchanged after an accident . In DaimlerChrysler , a Wesco employee was hurt while preparing a quote for electrical repair work at a DaimlerChrysler plant . 760 N.W.2d at 830 . After the accident , DC issued Wesco a purchase order for the quoted work , with language requiring Wesco to indemnify DC for losses "arising out of or related to the performance of any work in connection with this contract." Id . at 830_31 . The court held that the language of the post-accident purchase order did not show an intent to indemnify for pre-contract losses : It is one thing to decide whether an injury occurring during the term of the contract falls within the contract's coverage language , but it is quite another to decide whether a party has agreed to indemnify another for an injury that occurred before the indemnity provision was agreed upon . Hence , . . . we must look to whether the parties provided language that shows an intent to require indemnification for precontract activity . Id . at 834 . Finding no such terms in the purchase order , the court held Wesco had no obligation to indemnify DC for losses in connection with the pre-contract accident . Id . Similarly , in Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Estate of Lartius , an employer rented a crane for a day , and his employee was injured while using it . No . 06-1725 , 2007 WL 3087505 , at *1 .3 Twelve days later , the employer rented another crane from the same company , and when he returned it , he paid both days' rental fees and initialed a "work order" for both days that contained small-print indemnity language on the front . Id . The employer did not read the work order before initialing it , even though all parties were aware of the employee's injury . Id . Even though the employer's failure to read the work order did not make its terms unenforceable , the terms themselves could not be construed to impose retroactive liability because the contract language did not "specifically provide [ ] for . . . indemnification of Crane Rental's prior losses or liabilities" and therefore was "not sufficient to meet the plain and manifest intent requirement of Evans." Id . at *3_*4 . Bearing in mind the skepticism with which Indiana and other states view alleged agreements to indemnify retroactively for known losses , we now turn to Mid-America's contention that it reached such an agreement with the Commission through a long-running course of dealing . Though none of the indemnity language in this invoice expressly extends to losses prior to the invoice date , Mid-America argues that its course of dealing with the Commission established such an agreement-or at least raises a question of fact of whether such an agreement existed . Again , the parties stopped exchanging contracts before the Fair in 2002 and began using claim vouchers and invoices after the Fair-and then , starting in 2003 , the invoices included the same indemnity lan-guage at issue here . And the claim vouchers , which the Commission signed and submitted for payment , certified that the attached in-voices-including the indemnity language they contained-were "in accordance with [ the ] contract." In essence , Mid-America argues that under this course of dealing , the invoices' indemnity language is not being applied retroactively . Instead , it asserts that the invoices memorialized a standing recognition from each previous year's dealings that the following year's rental would be subject to the same indemnification requirements . But the Eighth Circuit , applying Nebraska law , rejected a similar argument in Emmet Fertilizer , 852 F.2d at 359_60 . There , Emmet had installed a fertilizer unloader at a railroad's facility in 1977 . Id . at 359 . Then in 1978 , an Emmet employee was badly hurt while operating the unloader and later settled a negligence claim against the railroad for his injuries . Id . The railroad then sought indemnification from Emmet based on indemnity language in a 1981 license agreement for the unloader . Id . The Emmet Court first observed that the license did not unambiguously provide for retroactive effect , and that " [ i ] f the parties had intended Emmet's indemnity obligation to extend to past accidents , they could easily have designed the language . . . to say exactly that." Id . at 360 . The Court then rejected an argument much like the course-of-dealing claim Mid-America makes here-that Emmet knew its installation would be subject to the indemnity provisions of the railroad's "standard license agreement , " which Emmet had signed twice before as part of similar installations : [ The railroad ] presents an alternate theory of recovery-that Emmet had orally agreed as early as 1976 to maintain its fertilizer unloader subject to [ the railroad's ] "standard license agreement." Emmet had previously signed two license agreements covering facilities similar to the fertilizer unloader , each of which contained an indemnity provision . [ The railroad ] reasons that the indemnity clauses of these earlier licenses were incorporated by reference into an implied oral agreement governing the fertilizer unloader from 1976 onward . Id . But the Court refused to rely on that course of dealing "to infer the existence of a type of obliga-tion that is not favored in Nebraska courts" in the absence of "clear and unequivocal language"-specifically noting that "Nebraska law requires specific proof of the indemnitor's intent to be bound by such an extraordinary obligation." Id . . We reach the same conclusion here , for the same reasons . As we have explained , Indiana law likewise requires a "clear and unequivocal" expression of a "knowing [ ] and willing [ ] " agreement to indemnify a party for its own negligence , GKN Co. , 798 N.E.2d at 552-and moreover , to say so "explicitly" if they further intend that liability "to cover existing losses , " Gen . Housewares , 741 N.E.2d at 414 . Even accepting all of Mid-America's evidence as true for purposes of summary judgment , see Hughley , 15 N.E.3d at 1003 , the parties' course of dealing can not substitute for a "clear and unequivocal" indication in the contract itself that the Commission "knowingly and willingly" agreed to indemnify Mid-America for its own negligence in connection with a cata-strophic loss that had already happened . See GKN Co. , 798 N.E.2d at 552 . Mid-America's reliance on Southern Railway Company v. Arlen Realty and Development Corp. , a Virginia case taking the opposite view , is misplaced . 257 S.E.2d 841 . There , Arlen leased trailers from the railroad for several years , usually executing the lease agreements after picking up the trailers . Id . at 842 . An Arlen employee sued the railroad after being injured while picking up a trailer . Id . at 842_43 . The railroad pursued Arlen based on indemnity language in the lease agreements , but Arlen argued the language was not binding because the lease was not signed until after the employee's accident . Id . at 843 , 845 . The court disagreed , "finding that the parties , by their course of dealings , had assented to and adopted the terms of the printed form as their agreement . . . in hundreds of transactions between the parties over a period of several years preceding" the employee's injury . Id . at 845 . But Virginia is an outlier in that it treats indemnity agreements just like any other contract . See Carpenter Insulation and Coatings Co. v. Statewide Sheet Metal and Roofing Corp. , 937 F.2d 602 , *3 . And , in more than 35 years , Arlen has been cited on this course-of-dealing issue only once-by the Court of Appeals' now-vacated decision in this case . Mid-America points to no other similar holding , and we find none . We therefore decline to follow Arlen , which represents a minority view based on different contract-law principles . In summary , then , the principle we deduce from Indiana contract law is this : Indemnification for another party's negligence-especially retroactively-is an "extraordinary obligation" that is generally "not favored." Emmet Fertilizer , 852 F.2d at 360 . Accordingly , as a matter of law , we will not infer that obligation from a course of dealing when , as here , the parties' contract does not expressly call for it in "clear and unequivocal terms." GKN Co. , 798 N.E.2d at 552 . The trial court therefore correctly granted summary judgment for the Commission and against Mid-America . In view of that conclusion , we express no opinion on whether the Commission is a govern-mental entity with immunity under the Indiana Tort Claims Act , Ind . Code ch . 34-13-3 ; whether indemnity for another party's negligence is a tort- or contract-based liability for ITCA purposes ; or whether the invoices' indemnity language is void against public policy . But those arguments do illustrate why Mid-America's failure to make a "clear and unequivocal" demand for retroactive indemnification is particularly significant in these circumstances . Regardless of their merits , those claims are not implausible-and therefore it seems that a party seeking to impose such a disfavored liability under these circumstances would have particular incentive to draft its contract in the clearest and most unequivocal terms possible . Mid-America's failure to do so here further underscores why we should not infer an extraordinary liability when a contract fails to provide for it expressly .</body>
