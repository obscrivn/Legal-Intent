<body>Indiana courts strictly construe contracts to indemnify a party against its own negligenceârecognizing that a party would not lightly accept liability for someone elseÃs negligence . Thus , indemnity clauses must state the partiesÃ intent to indemnify in clear and unequivocal language . Otherwise , we will not find a knowing and willing agreement to indemnify . And the need for explicit language is especially important when an agreement involves retroactive indemnityâsince even in insurance contracts , where indemnity is the central purpose , we presume that insurers would not accept liability for a known , existing loss . Here , Mid-America Sound argues that the Indiana State Fair Commission accepted liability for an existing , catastrophic lossânot through explicit contract language calling for retroactive indemnification , but through a years-long course of conduct in paying invoices that had standard indemnity language on the back . But as a matter of law , a form of liability so disfavored can not be implied from a course of dealing when it is not expressed by clear and unequivocal contract language . We therefore grant transfer and affirm the trial courtÃs grant of sum-mary judgment for the Commission . Indiana has held its famed State Fair nearly every year since 1852 . An evolving Hoosier tradition , the Fair has become more than just an agricultural exposition . It is now a major commercial event for the general public , attracting rural and urban Hoosiers alikeâfeaturing concerts , tractor pulls , demolition derbies , monster truck shows , and a seemingly boundless supply of food . The Indiana State Fair Commission manages the Fair , and by extension , the concerts and other major events that take place at the Fair . Since the 1990s , the Commission uti-lized Mid-America Sound to provide equipment and services for those concerts and events . That equipment often included a temporary roof for the grandstand stage , speakers , and lights . During the last ten years of their relationship , the Commission and Mid-America followed a standard routine . Before each Fair , they agreed on the equipment to be delivered and the corre-sponding prices . Then after the Fair , Mid-America would collect the equipment and submit a blank claim voucher form,1 with invoices for the rentals attached . The Commission would then verify whether all the invoiced items had actually been provided and , if so , sign the claim voucher to authorize payment . All told , the parties followed this course of dealing more than a hundred times over those ten years . Tragedy struck on the night of August 13 , 2011 . Just prior to the Sugarland concert at the grandstand stage , strong winds approached the Fairgrounds . While Mid-AmericaÃs on-site technicians worked to remove equipment hanging from Mid-AmericaÃs roof , the roof collapsed , killing seven people and injuring many more . Shortly thereafter , the victims and families filed law-suits naming several defendants , including Mid-America and the Commission . Then , on December 7 , 2011 , while those lawsuits were still pending , Mid-America sent the Commission a two-sided invoice for the lease of the collapsed roof and services provided , along with the single-sided claim voucher form . Above the CommissionÃs signature , the voucher contained certifications Ã±that the attached invoice is true and correctÃ® and Ã±in accordance with contract.Ã® The Commission signed the voucher and authorized payment , which it remitted via check . In March 2012 , Mid-America filed a third-party lawsuit against the Commission , claiming that two sentences located on the back of the December 2011 invoice entitled it to indemnification for its own negligence in relation to the August 2011 roof collapse . One of the two sentences , located under a heading entitled Ã±Rentals , Ã® read as follows : [ The Commission ] assumes risks inherent in the operation and use of the equipment and agrees to assume the entire responsibility for the defense of , and to pay , indemnify and hold [ Mid-America ] harmless from and hereby releases [ Mid-America ] from any and all claims for damage to property or bodily injury resulting from the use , operation or possession of the equipment , whether or not it be claimed or held that such damage or injury resulted in whole or in part from [ Mid-AmericaÃs ] negligence , from the condition of the equipment or from any cause , [ the Commission ] agrees that no warranties , expressed or implied have been made in connection with this rental . The other sentence , located under the Ã±ShowsÃ® heading , set forth essentially the same language . Mid-America and the Commission proceeded to file cross-motions for summary judgment , taking opposite positions about whether the December 2011 invoiceÃs indemnity language applied retroactively to the August 2011 roof collapse . The trial court granted the CommissionÃs motion , and Mid-America appealed . A divided Court of Appeals reversed and remanded , finding that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether the Commission knowingly and willingly agreed to indemnify Mid-America for the roof collapse . In re Ind . State Fair Litigation , 28 N.E.3d 333 , 343 . As we have recently reiterated , summary judgment imposes a heavy factual burden on the moving partyâand a correspondingly light burden for the non-movantÃs responseâbecause Ã±Indiana consciously errs on the side of letting marginal cases proceed to trial on the merits , rather than risk short-circuiting meritorious claims.Ã® Hughley v. State , 15 N.E.3d 1000 , 1004 . By definition , cases that hinge upon disputed facts are inappropriate for summary judgment , because Ã±weighing [ evidence ] âno matter how decisively the scales may seem to tipâ [ is ] a matter for trial , not summary judgment.Ã® Id . at 1005_06 . By contrast , matters of contract interpretation are Ã±particularly well-suited for de novo appellate review , Ã® because they Ã±generally present [ ] questions purely of law.Ã® Holiday Hospitality Franchising , Inc. v. AMCO Ins . Co. , 983 N.E.2d 574 , 577 . A contract may be construed on summary judgment if it Ã±is not ambiguous or uncertain , Ã® or if Ã±the contract ambiguity , if one exists , can be resolved without the aid of a factual determination.Ã® Warrick County ex rel . Conner v. Hill , 973 N.E.2d 1138 , 1144 , trans . denied . The meaning of a contract is a question for the factfinder , precluding summary judgment , only where interpreting an ambiguity requires extrinsic evidence . Tate v. Secura Ins. , 587 N.E.2d 665 , 668 . Moreover , our standard of review remains unchanged when , as here , the parties file cross-motions for summary judgmentâwe simply Ã±consider each motion separately to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Ã® SCI Propane , LLC v. Frederick , 39 N.E.3d</body>
