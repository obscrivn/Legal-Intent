The	DT

that	IN

in	IN

stated	VBN
above	IN

where	WRB
the	DT

Indiana	NNP

By	IN

that	IN

,	,
various	JJ

are	VBP
placed	VBN
upon	IN
receiving	VBG
payment	NN
of	IN
the	DT
principal	JJ
amount	NN
,	,
which	WDT
makes	VBZ
the	DT
Note	NNP
starkly	VBD
distinguishable	JJ
from	IN
a	DT
cash	NN

.	.
First	NNP
,	,
the	DT
principal	NN
of	IN
the	DT
Note	NNP
was	VBD
not	RB
due	JJ
until	IN
three	CD

Second	NNP

the	DT

unsecured	JJ
and	CC
subordinate	NN

large	JJ
bank	NN

that	WDT
AM	VBP

Finally	RB
,	,
the	DT
Note	NN
could	MD
only	RB

transferred	VBN
under	IN

Thus	RB
,	,
these	DT
conditions	NNS
create	VBP
the	DT
possibility	NN
that	IN

Moreover	RB

the	DT
