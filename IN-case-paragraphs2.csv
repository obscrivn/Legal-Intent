1,"Indiana courts strictly construe contracts to indemnify a party against its own negligence_recognizing that a party would not lightly accept liability for someone elses negligence. Thus, indemnity clauses must state the parties intent to indemnify in clear and unequivocal language. Otherwise, we will not find a knowing and willing agreement to indemnify. And the need for explicit language is especially important when an agreement involves retroactive indemnity_since even in insurance contracts, where indemnity is the central purpose, we presume that insurers would not accept liability for a known, existing loss.","Here, Mid-America Sound argues that the Indiana State Fair Commission accepted liability for an existing, catastrophic loss_not through explicit contract language calling for retroactive indemnification, but through a years-long course of conduct in paying invoices that had standard indemnity language on the back. But as a matter of law, a form of liability so disfavored (especially when retroactive) cannot be implied from a course of dealing when it is not expressed by clear and unequivocal contract language. We therefore grant transfer and affirm the trial courts grant of sum-mary judgment for the Commission.","Indiana has held its famed State Fair nearly every year since 1852. An evolving Hoosier tradition, the Fair has become more than just an agricultural exposition. It is now a major commercial event for the general public, attracting rural and urban Hoosiers alike_featuring concerts, tractor pulls, demolition derbies, monster truck shows, and a seemingly boundless supply of food.","The Indiana State Fair Commission (the 瘫Commission台) manages the Fair, and by extension, the concerts and other major events that take place at the Fair. Since the 1990s, the Commission uti-lized Mid-America Sound (瘫Mid-America台) to provide equipment and services for those concerts and events. That equipment often included a temporary roof for the grandstand stage, speakers, and lights.","During the last ten years of their relationship, the Commission and Mid-America followed a standard routine. Before each Fair, they agreed on the equipment to be delivered and the corre-sponding prices. Then after the Fair, Mid-America would collect the equipment and submit a blank claim voucher form,1 with invoices for the rentals attached. The Commission would then verify whether all the invoiced items had actually been provided and, if so, sign the claim voucher to authorize payment. All told, the parties followed this course of dealing more than a hundred times over those ten years.","Tragedy struck on the night of August 13, 2011. Just prior to the Sugarland concert at the grandstand stage, strong winds approached the Fairgrounds. While Mid-Americas on-site technicians worked to remove equipment hanging from Mid-Americas roof, the roof collapsed, killing seven people and injuring many more. Shortly thereafter, the victims and families filed law-suits naming several defendants, including Mid-America and the Commission. Then, on December 7, 2011, while those lawsuits were still pending, Mid-America sent the Commission a two-sided invoice for the lease of the collapsed roof and services provided, along with the single-sided claim voucher form. Above the Commissions signature, the voucher contained certifications 瘫that the attached invoice is true and correct台 and 瘫in accordance with contract.台 The Commission signed the voucher and authorized payment, which it remitted via check.","In March 2012, Mid-America filed a third-party lawsuit against the Commission, claiming that two sentences located on the back of the December 2011 invoice entitled it to indemnification for its own negligence in relation to the August 2011 roof collapse. One of the two sentences, located under a heading entitled 瘫Rentals,台 read as follows:  [The Commission] assumes risks inherent in the operation and use of the equipment and agrees to assume the entire responsibility for the defense of, and to pay, indemnify and hold [Mid-America] harmless from and hereby releases [Mid-America] from any and all claims for damage to property or bodily injury (including loss of life) resulting from the use, operation or possession of the equipment, whether or not it be claimed or held that such damage or injury resulted in whole or in part from [Mid-Americas] negligence, from the condition of the equipment or from any cause, [the Commission] agrees that no warranties, expressed or implied have been made in connection with this rental.  The other sentence, located under the 瘫Shows台 heading, set forth essentially the same language.","Mid-America and the Commission proceeded to file cross-motions for summary judgment, taking opposite positions about whether the December 2011 invoices indemnity language applied retroactively to the August 2011 roof collapse. The trial court granted the Commissions motion, and Mid-America appealed. A divided Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, finding that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether the Commission knowingly and willingly agreed to indemnify Mid-America for the roof collapse. In re Ind. State Fair Litigation, 28 N.E.3d 333, 343 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015).","As we have recently reiterated, summary judgment imposes a heavy factual burden on the moving party_and a correspondingly light burden for the non-movants response_because 瘫Indiana consciously errs on the side of letting marginal cases proceed to trial on the merits, rather than risk short-circuiting meritorious claims.台 Hughley v. State, 15 N.E.3d 1000, 1004 (Ind. 2014). By definition, cases that hinge upon disputed facts are inappropriate for summary judgment, because 瘫weighing [evidence]_no matter how decisively the scales may seem to tip_[is] a matter for trial, not summary judgment.台 Id. at 1005_06.","By contrast, matters of contract interpretation are 瘫particularly well-suited for de novo appellate review,台 because they 瘫generally present[] questions purely of law.台 Holiday Hospitality Franchising, Inc. v. AMCO Ins. Co., 983 N.E.2d 574, 577 (Ind. 2013). A contract may be construed on summary judgment if it 瘫is not ambiguous or uncertain,台 or if 瘫the contract ambiguity, if one exists, can be resolved without the aid of a factual determination.台 Warrick County ex rel. Conner v. Hill, 973 N.E.2d 1138, 1144 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012), trans. denied. The meaning of a contract is a question for the factfinder, precluding summary judgment, only where interpreting an ambiguity requires extrinsic evidence. Tate v. Secura Ins., 587 N.E.2d 665, 668 (Ind. 1992).","Moreover, our standard of review remains unchanged when, as here, the parties file cross-motions for summary judgment_we simply 瘫consider each motion separately to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.台 SCI Propane, LLC v. Frederick, 39 N.E.3d 675, 677 (Ind. 2015) (quoting Reed v. Reid, 980 N.E.2d 277, 285 (Ind. 2012)).","Our analysis begins with a dim view of indemnity clauses like the one at issue here. At one time, Indiana flatly prohibited at least some contracts for indemnity against a partys own negligence.  See, e.g., Freigy v. Gargaro Co., 223 Ind. 342, 352, 60 N.E.2d 288, 292 (1945); Penn. R. Co. v. Kent, 136 Ind. App. 551, 560, 198 N.E.2d 615, 619 (1964) (瘫[A] railway company acting as a common carrier may not contract for indemnity against its own tort liability when it is performing either a public or quasi public duty such as that owing to a shipper, passenger, or servant, and . . . such contracts are void as against public policy.台 (emphases omitted)). We later retreated from that prohibition and now generally allow parties, as a matter of freedom of contract, 瘫to allocate risk by contract台_including by agreeing to 瘫indemnification for ones own negligence.台 Fresh Cut, Inc. v. Fazli, 650 N.E.2d 1126, 1130 (Ind. 1995) (citing Indianapolis Power & Light Co. v. Brad Snodgrass, Inc., 578 N.E.2d 669, 670 (Ind. 1991)). Even so, indemnity provisions are strictly con-strued_we treat them as 瘫disfavor[ed] . . . because we are mindful that to obligate one party to pay for the negligence of another is a harsh burden that no party would lightly accept.台 Henthorne v. Legacy Healthcare, Inc., 764 N.E.2d 751, 757 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002). Accordingly, indemnity is permissible only if the contract language shows in 瘫clear and unequivocal terms台 that the obligated party 瘫knowingly and willingly agrees to such indemnification.台 Id.","Moreover, our courts have generally taken for granted that the parties would be bargaining about prospective liability, by referring to 瘫future acts of negligence台 or making the agreement 瘫in advance.台 E.g., Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 578 N.E.2d at 670 (瘫The rule in this state is that parties may by express contract lawfully indemnify against future acts of negligence.台); Powell v. Am. Health Fitness Ctr. of Fort Wayne, Inc., 694 N.E.2d 757, 760 (Ind. Ct. App. 1998) (瘫[P]arties are permitted to agree in advance that one is under no obligation of care for the benefit of the other, and shall not be liable for the consequences of conduct which would otherwise be negligent.台 (emphasis added) (quoting Marshall v. Blue Springs Corp., 641 N.E.2d 92, 95 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994))). That assumption_that parties would bargain over only prospective liability_is rooted in the very nature of allocating risk.","One context in which Indiana has recognized that assumption is the 瘫known loss台 doctrine in insurance law_which embodies the commonsense principle that a party cannot 瘫insure台 against a loss that has already happened, because there is no 瘫risk台 left to be allocated:  The 瘫known loss台 doctrine is a common law concept deriving from the fundamental requirement in insurance law that the loss be fortuitous. Simply put, the known loss doctrine states that one may not obtain insurance for a loss that has already taken place. Describing the known loss doctrine, commentators have noted that losses which exist at the time of the insuring agreement, or which are so probable or imminent that there is insufficient 瘫risk台 being transferred between the insured and insurer, are not proper subjects of insurance.  . . .  . . . [W]e hold that if an insured has actual knowledge that a loss has occurred, is occurring, or is substantially certain to occur on or before the effective date of the policy, the known loss doctrine will bar coverage. This is not to say, however, that parties may not explicitly agree to cover existing losses. Indeed, the known loss doctrine is inapplicable if the insurer also knew of the circumstances on which it bases the defense.  Gen. Housewares Corp. v. Natl Sur. Corp., 741 N.E.2d 408, 413_14 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (citing, inter alia, 7 Lee R. Russ and Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance, _ 102:8 at 20_21 (3d ed. 1997)).","The basic rationale of the known-loss rule applies with equal force in the context of this non-insurance indemnity provision. If a potential future liability 瘫is a harsh burden that a party would not lightly accept,台 GKN Co. v. Starnes Trucking, Inc., 798 N.E.2d 548, 552 (Ind. Ct. App. 2003), then actual retroactive liability for a known loss is harsher still_indeed, it would ordinarily be a fools bargain. 瘫This is not to say, however, that parties may not explicitly agree to cover existing losses,台 Gen. Housewares, 741 N.E.2d at 414 (emphasis added)_that is, 瘫in clear and unequivocal terms,台 to be strictly construed. GKN Co., 798 N.E.2d at 552. But Indiana law makes clear that we will not infer a partys agreement to such an onerous liability unless that intent is expressed unmistakably.","Though Indiana contract law suggests a particularly strong disfavor for retroactive indemnity provisions as discussed above, we have never squarely addressed the retroactivity question. Nine other jurisdictions, however, have similarly concluded that such an extraordinary obligation as retro-active indemnity must be expressed unmistakably. Georgia states the rule particularly emphatically, requiring agreements for retroactive indemnity to be stated 瘫expressly, plainly, clearly, and unequi-vocally台 to be valid. Service Merch. Co. v. Hunter Fan Co., 617 S.E.2d 235, 240 (Ga. Ct. App. 2005).  Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, and New York declare similar standards, requiring such provisions to be completely unambiguous. Fina, Inc. v. ARCO, 200 F.3d 266, 273 (5th Cir. 2000) (Delaware law); Chicago & N.W. Transp. Co. v. Emmet Fertilizer & Grain Co., 852 F.2d 358, 360 (8th Cir. 1988) (finding that under Nebraska law, 瘫[i]f the parties had intended [the] indemnity obligation to extend to past accidents, they could easily have designed the language . . . to say exactly that.台); Servco Pac. Inc. v. Dods, 193 F. Supp. 2d 1183, 1193 (D. Haw. 2002) (holding that retroactive indemnity provision must be stated 瘫clearly and unequivocally台); DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Wesco Distribution, Inc., 760 N.W.2d 828, 833 (Mich. Ct. App. 2008) (noting that an indemnity clause 瘫cannot be construed to operate retrospectively unless . . . the parties expressly provide so in their agreement台 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)); Quality King Distribs., Inc. v. E & M ESR, Inc., 827 N.Y.S.2d 700, 703 (N.Y.

Howard R. Green Co., 231 N.W.2d 907, 916_17 (Iowa 1975) (noting that such clauses must 瘫plainly manifest[] an intention, not to be limited to future losses or liabilities, but also to cover past transactions and existing losses or liabilities台 (quoting 42 C.J.S. Indemnity _ 12(b), p. 581)). And Maryland and Pennsylvania simply take for granted_seemingly as too obvious for analysis_that indemnity clauses cannot apply to liabilities that predate the contract. See Bunker Ramo-Eltra Corp. v. Fairchild Indus., 639 F. Supp. 409, 419 (D. Md. 1986) (holding that indemnity clause of stock-purchase agreement did not apply to a different share purchase prior to the date of the agreement); Werner v. Big Sky Shop, 630 F. Supp. 444, 451 (E.D. Pa. 1985) (holding that indemnity provision in contract did not extend to an injury that occurred seven months earlier).","Each of these decisions is consistent with Indianas requirement of 瘫clear and unequivocal台 language_construing such provisions strictly, as New York has explained, 瘫to avoid reading into them duties which the parties did not intend to be assumed.台 Quality King, 827 N.Y.S.2d at 702. But two cases, one from Michigan and one from Iowa, are particularly analogous, because they involve indemnity language contained in routine, standard-form documents exchanged after an accident.  ","In DaimlerChrysler, a Wesco employee was hurt while preparing a quote for electrical repair work at a DaimlerChrysler (瘫DC台) plant. 760 N.W.2d at 830. After the accident, DC issued Wesco a purchase order for the quoted work, with language requiring Wesco to indemnify DC for losses 瘫arising out of or related to the performance of any work in connection with this contract.台 Id. at 830_31. The court held that the language of the post-accident purchase order did not show an intent to indemnify for pre-contract losses:  It is one thing to decide whether an injury occurring during the term of the contract falls within the contracts coverage language, but it is quite another to decide whether a party has agreed to indemnify another for an injury that occurred before the indemnity provision was agreed upon. Hence, . . . we must look to whether the parties provided language that shows an intent to require indemnification for precontract activity.  Id. at 834. Finding no such terms in the purchase order, the court held Wesco had no obligation to indemnify DC for losses in connection with the pre-contract accident. Id.","Similarly, in Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Estate of Lartius, an employer rented a crane for a day, and his employee was injured while using it. No. 06-1725, 2007 WL 3087505, at *1 (Iowa Ct. App. Oct. 24, 2007).3 Twelve days later, the employer rented another crane from the same company, and when he returned it, he paid both days rental fees and initialed a 瘫work order台 for both days that contained small-print indemnity language on the front. Id. The employer did not read the work order before initialing it, even though all parties were aware of the employees injury. Id. Even though the employers failure to read the work order did not make its terms unenforceable, the terms themselves could not be construed to impose retroactive liability because the contract language did not 瘫specifically provide[] for . . . indemnification of Crane Rentals prior losses or liabilities台 and therefore was 瘫not sufficient to meet the plain and manifest intent requirement of Evans.台 Id. at *3_*4 (citing Evans, 231 N.W.2d at 917).","Bearing in mind the skepticism with which Indiana and other states view alleged agreements to indemnify retroactively for known losses, we now turn to Mid-Americas contention that it reached such an agreement with the Commission through a long-running course of dealing.","Though none of the indemnity language in this invoice expressly extends to losses prior to the invoice date, Mid-America argues that its course of dealing with the Commission established such an agreement_or at least raises a question of fact of whether such an agreement existed. Again, the parties stopped exchanging contracts before the Fair in 2002 and began using claim vouchers and invoices after the Fair_and then, starting in 2003, the invoices included the same indemnity lan-guage at issue here. (For purposes of the Commissions motion for summary judgment, we also take as true Mid-Americas contention that it added that language because of a disagreement at a previous years Fair about how to handle a potential safety hazard during inclement weather.) And the claim vouchers, which the Commission signed and submitted for payment, certified that the attached in-voices_including the indemnity language they contained_were 瘫in accordance with [the] contract.台","In essence, Mid-America argues that under this course of dealing, the invoices indemnity language is not being applied retroactively. Instead, it asserts that the invoices memorialized a standing recognition from each previous years dealings that the following years rental would be subject to the same indemnification requirements. But the Eighth Circuit, applying Nebraska law, rejected a similar argument in Emmet Fertilizer, 852 F.2d at 359_60. There, Emmet had installed a fertilizer unloader at a railroads facility in 1977. Id. at 359. Then in 1978, an Emmet employee was badly hurt while operating the unloader and later settled a negligence claim against the railroad for his injuries. Id. The railroad then sought indemnification from Emmet based on indemnity language in a 1981 license agreement for the unloader. Id. The Emmet Court first observed that the license did not unambiguously provide for retroactive effect, and that 瘫[i]f the parties had intended Emmets indemnity obligation to extend to past accidents, they could easily have designed the language . . . to say exactly that.台 Id. at 360.","The Court then rejected an argument much like the course-of-dealing claim Mid-America makes here_that Emmet knew its installation would be subject to the indemnity provisions of the railroads 瘫standard license agreement,台 which Emmet had signed twice before as part of similar installations:  [The railroad] presents an alternate theory of recovery_that Emmet had orally agreed as early as 1976 to maintain its fertilizer unloader subject to [the railroads] 瘫standard license agreement.台 Emmet had previously signed two license agreements covering facilities similar to the fertilizer unloader, each of which contained an indemnity provision. [The railroad] reasons that the indemnity clauses of these earlier licenses were incorporated by reference into an implied oral agreement governing the fertilizer unloader from 1976 onward.  Id. But the Court refused to rely on that course of dealing 瘫to infer the existence of a type of obliga-tion that is not favored in Nebraska courts台 in the absence of 瘫clear and unequivocal language台_specifically noting that 瘫Nebraska law requires specific proof of the indemnitors intent to be bound by such an extraordinary obligation.台 Id. (citation omitted).","We reach the same conclusion here, for the same reasons. As we have explained, Indiana law likewise requires a 瘫clear and unequivocal台 expression of a 瘫knowing[] and willing[]台 agreement to indemnify a party for its own negligence, GKN Co., 798 N.E.2d at 552_and moreover, to say so 瘫explicitly台 if they further intend that liability 瘫to cover existing losses,台 Gen. Housewares, 741 N.E.2d at 414. Even accepting all of Mid-Americas evidence as true for purposes of summary judgment, see Hughley, 15 N.E.3d at 1003, the parties course of dealing cannot substitute for a 瘫clear and unequivocal台 indication in the contract itself that the Commission 瘫knowingly and willingly台 agreed to indemnify Mid-America for its own negligence in connection with a cata-strophic loss that had already happened. See GKN Co., 798 N.E.2d at 552.","Mid-Americas reliance on Southern Railway Company v. Arlen Realty & Development Corp., a Virginia case taking the opposite view, is misplaced. 257 S.E.2d 841 (Va. 1979). There, Arlen leased trailers from the railroad for several years, usually executing the lease agreements after picking up the trailers. Id. at 842. An Arlen employee sued the railroad after being injured while picking up a trailer. Id. at 842_43. The railroad pursued Arlen based on indemnity language in the lease agreements, but Arlen argued the language was not binding because the lease was not signed until after the employees accident. Id. at 843, 845. The court disagreed, 瘫finding that the parties, by their course of dealings, had assented to and adopted the terms of the printed form as their agreement . . . in hundreds of transactions between the parties over a period of several years preceding台 the employees injury. Id. at 845. But Virginia is an outlier in that it treats indemnity agreements just like any other contract. See Carpenter Insulation & Coatings Co. v. Statewide Sheet Metal & Roofing Corp., 937 F.2d 602, *3 (4th Cir. 1991) (unpublished) (瘫Under Virginia law, indemnity contracts are construed under the general rules that govern the interpretation of any other type of contract.台). And, in more than 35 years, Arlen has been cited on this course-of-dealing issue only once_by the Court of Appeals now-vacated decision in this case. Mid-America points to no other similar holding, and we find none. We therefore decline to follow Arlen, which represents a minority view based on different contract-law principles.","In summary, then, the principle we deduce from Indiana contract law (and confirmed by the States that follow similar principles) is this: Indemnification for another partys negligence_especially retroactively_is an 瘫extraordinary obligation台 that is generally 瘫not favored.台 Emmet Fertilizer, 852 F.2d at 360. Accordingly, as a matter of law, we will not infer that obligation from a course of dealing when, as here, the parties contract does not expressly call for it in 瘫clear and unequivocal terms.台 GKN Co., 798 N.E.2d at 552. The trial court therefore correctly granted summary judgment for the Commission and against Mid-America.","In view of that conclusion, we express no opinion on whether the Commission is a govern-mental entity with immunity under the Indiana Tort Claims Act (ITCA), Ind. Code ch. 34-13-3; whether indemnity for another partys negligence is a tort- or contract-based liability for ITCA purposes; or whether the invoices indemnity language is void against public policy. But those arguments do illustrate why Mid-Americas failure to make a 瘫clear and unequivocal台 demand for retroactive indemnification is particularly significant in these circumstances. Regardless of their merits, those claims are not implausible_and therefore it seems that a party seeking to impose such a disfavored liability under these circumstances would have particular incentive to draft its contract in the clearest and most unequivocal terms possible. Mid-Americas failure to do so here further underscores why we should not infer an extraordinary liability when a contract fails to provide for it expressly.","The terms of Mid-Americas invoices to the Commission did not clearly and unequivocally provide for retroactive application, and as a matter of law, we will not infer such an onerous provision from the parties course of dealing. We therefore affirm the trial courts grant of summary judgment to the Commission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of two counts of Class B felony Burglary for breaking and entering into a farmhouse. Because the jury instruction's expansion of the statutory definition of a ""dwelling"" for purposes of Class B felony Burglary included misleading language and invaded the province of the jury, we direct the trial court to change the Class B felony Burglary convictions to Class C felony Burglary convictions and to resentence the defendant accordingly.","The defendant, Shane Keller, was convicted of eight felonies_three counts of Burglary, three counts of Theft, and two counts of Receiving Stolen Property_for taking possessions from a farm in Washington County, Indiana, between May and September of 2013. Two of the burglary convictions resulted from breaking and entering into an old farmhouse on the property. Jeremy Hardwick, who planned to move his family into the farmhouse ""in a short period,"" was remodeling the farmhouse because it had been in ""pretty rough"" shape after sitting empty for ten to twelve years. Tr. at 501, 503. He was at the farm every day after work, feeding the animals and working on the house. The school bus dropped his daughter off at the farm in the afternoon, and he had his mail delivered there as well. The Hardwick family stored all of their belongings_except beds and the clothes they wore on a daily basis_at the farmhouse, mostly packed in boxes or piled around the house. The farmhouse had one completed bathroom, new drywall and plumbing, and a new electrical system, but several parts of the house still needed finished, including flooring, kitchen cabinets, trim, and appliance installation.","The defendant's two Class B felony Burglary convictions for breaking into the farmhouse required the jury to find that the ""building or structure"" broken into was a ""dwelling.""1 At trial, the parties argued extensively about how the jury instructions should define a dwelling. The defendant proposed an instruction matching the statutory definition of ""a building, structure, or other enclosed space, permanent or temporary, movable or fixed, that is a person's home or place of lodging."" Appellant's App'x at 568; Ind. Code _ 35-31.5-2-107. The State's proposed instruction also included that statutory definition, but added a sentence based on a separate decision of the Court of Appeals discussing sufficiency of the evidence: ""Any such place where a person keeps personal items with the intent to reside at some future time is considered a dwelling."" Appellant's App'x at 544; accord White v. State 846 N.E.2d 1026, 1031 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006) (finding that sufficient evidence qualified a house as a dwelling when the victim was moving in and intended to take up permanent residence ""in the near future""). The final instruction given the jury read:  For the purposes of the burglary [statute], a dwelling is defined as a building, structure, or other enclosed space, permanent or temporary, movable or fixed, that is a person's home or place of lodging. Any such place where a person keeps personal items with the intent to reside in the near future is considered a dwelling.  Appellant's App'x at 596. Informed by this instruction, the jury found the defendant guilty of both counts of Class B felony Burglary. The defendant appealed, alleging error in the dwelling instruction, multiple evidentiary errors, double jeopardy violations, and sentence inappropriateness. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing. Keller v. State, 25 N.E.3d 807 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015). The State petitioned for transfer, challenging the sufficiency analysis employed by the Court of Appeals_an issue not presented by the defendant. We granted transfer, thus assuming jurisdiction over the appeal and all issues. Ind. App. R. 58(A). We address only the instructional error issue and otherwise summarily affirm the Court of Appeals. Id.","In his challenge to the final instruction defining a dwelling, the defendant argues that ""[t]he trial court erred by instructing the jury beyond the statutory definition of dwelling . . . . [by adding language that] unfairly emphasized particular facts, invaded the province of the jury and misled the jury."" Appellant's Br. at 10. ""We review a trial court's instructions to the jury for an abuse of discretion."" Isom v. State, 31 N.E.3d 469, 484 (Ind. 2015). The trial court abuses its discretion ""when the instruction is erroneous and the instructions taken as a whole misstate the law or otherwise mislead the jury.""2 Id. at 484-85. The challenged final instruction amplified the statutory definition of a dwelling by telling the jury that the definition would be satisfied by a specific set of facts not identified by the statute.","Article 1, Section 19 of the Indiana Constitution protects the province of the jury in criminal trials: ""In all criminal cases whatever, the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts."" An instruction that invades this province by inappropriately emphasizing certain facts is erroneous and misleads the jury. See Ludy v. State, 784 N.E.2d 459, 461 (Ind. 2003) (""Instructions that unnecessarily emphasize one particular evidentiary fact, witness, or phase of the case have long been disapproved.""). Here, the last sentence of the dwelling instruction told the jury that ""[a]ny such place where a person keeps personal items with the intent to reside in the near future is considered a dwelling."" Appellant's App'x at 596. By emphasizing a set of facts that would satisfy the statutory definition of a dwelling, this language restricted the jury's discretion in applying the statutory definition in light of all the admitted evidence about the farmhouse. This also misled the jury by encouraging it to single out certain facts while ignoring others that it may and should consider. See Fry v. State, 447 N.E.2d 569, 573 (Ind. 1983) (overruled on other grounds). Under our Constitution, ""it [is] the province of the jury to determine the weight to be given . . . each item placed in evidence."" Woodson v. State, 542 N.E.2d 1331, 1334 (Ind. 1989). Because the last sentence of the instruction ""invite[d the jury] to violate its obligation to consider all the evidence,"" the instruction invaded the province of the jury in violation of the Indiana Constitution. Ludy, 784 N.E.2d at 462.","The State argues that ""[t]he trial court did not abuse its discretion because the instruction is rooted in binding precedent."" Appellee's Br. at 15.3 But as explained above, ingraining a single example of a dwelling into an instruction emphasizes certain facts, which invades the province of the jury. For this reason, we have long held that the ""mere fact that certain language or expression [is] used in the opinions of this Court to reach its final conclusion does not make it proper language for instructions to a jury."" Ludy, 784 N.E.2d at 462 (alteration in original).4 Appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence, as in White, will ""rarely, if ever,"" be an appropriate basis for a jury instruction, because the determination is fundamentally different.  Garfield v. State, 74 Ind. 60, 64 (1881).5 ""[A] trial court jury is not reviewing whether aconviction is supported. It is determining in the first instance whether the State proved beyond areasonable doubt that a defendant committed a charged crime."" Ludy, 784 N.E.2d at 461. Whilethe instruction accurately reflected the holding in White, that case addressed an appellate legalissue_the sufficiency the evidence_and not the facts of this case, which are reserved for the jury.White, 846 N.E.2d at 1030-31.6 White does not justify the instruction.","The addition of the last sentence to the challenged final instruction was misleading andinvaded the province of the jury and was therefore erroneous. We thus reverse the defendant'sClass B felony Burglary convictions. Under the Burglary statute at the time of the offenses,Burglary was a Class C felony, but was enhanced to a Class B felony if the building or structurebroken into was a dwelling. Because the erroneous language only related to the dwellingelement, we instruct the trial court to modify the two Class B felony Burglary convictions fromClass B felonies to Class C felonies and to resentence the defendant accordingly. See Bradley v.State, 867 N.E.2d 1282, 1286 (Ind. 2007). As to the other appellate issues we summarily affirmthe Court of Appeals.7 Ind. App. R. 58(A)(2)."," As established, the trial court's dwelling instruction erroneously amplified the statutorydefinition of a dwelling for Burglary as a Class B felony by declaring that a specific set of factsconstitute a dwelling instead of leaving the jury to determine the issue. We therefore reverse thetwo convictions for Burglary as Class B felonies and remand for the entry of two replacementconvictions for Burglary as Class C felonies and for resentencing of the defendant accordingly.As to the defendant's other six convictions, the Court of Appeals is summarily affirmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Today we undertake to resolve various disputes between governmental entities in BooneCounty, Indiana, arising under the Indiana Government Modernization Act (""GMA""), IndianaCode Section 36-1.5-1-1 et seq. We reverse both the trial court's rejection of the GMAreorganization of Zionsville and Perry Township and its approval of Whitestown's attempts toannex territory included in the 2014 Zionsville-Perry reorganization plan and territory includedin Zionsville's previous 2010 reorganization.","This appeal arises from a declaratory judgment action by the Town of Whitestown,Indiana, and Angel Badillo, a resident of Perry Township (collectively ""Whitestown""), seekingjudicial declarations (a) that the Zionsville and Perry Township reorganization is contrary to law;(b) that if not unlawful, it requires a specific separate approval by each participating townshipand municipality; and (c) that the Town of Whitestown may initiate and/or proceed with certainannexations. The Town of Zionsville counter-claimed seeking declaratory judgment in its favoron the same issues and also asserting a breach of an interlocal agreement between the two towns.","Acting under the GMA in 2010, the Town of Zionsville reorganized with theunincorporated areas of Eagle Township and all of Union Township (""2010 Reorganization"").This reorganization resulted in a new political subdivision, described in the 2010 Reorganizationdocuments as ""one governmental entity to be known as the Town of Zionsville . . . .""Appellants App'x at 0294. The 2010 Reorganization did not include the nearby Town ofWhitestown, which before the reorganization was geographically located in parts of Worth,Perry, and Eagle Townships in Boone County, Indiana.","On March 26, 2013, the Town Council of Whitestown adopted Ordinance 2012-22 (2012Southside Annexation, introduced November 13, 2012) to annex certain territory in PerryTownship that included a Whitestown wastewater treatment plant. The landowners filed aremonstrance, and the case is currently pending transfer to this Court in Cause No. 29A05-1409-MI-00437.","On April 18, 2014, the Perry Township Advisory Board and the Perry Township Trusteeadopted a resolution (No. 2014-01) proposing to reorganize with Zionsville. On April 21, 2014,the Zionsville Town Council adopted a resolution (No. 2014-10) to participate in a proposedreorganization with Perry Township. The proposed reorganization between Zionsville and PerryTownship (""2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization"") did not include Whitestown. On April 22,2014, at a meeting of the Whitestown Town Council, four annexation ordinances (Ordinances2014-12, 2014-13, 2014-14, and 2014-15) were introduced proposing the annexation of certainterritory included in the proposed reorganization between Zionsville and Perry Township andterritory already within Zionsville. The Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan was finallyadopted by Zionsville and Perry Township on May 20, 2014, and was to be submitted to thevoters in the two reorganizing political subdivisions in the general election of November 4, 2014.","On June 25, 2014, Whitestown filed a complaint against Zionsville seeking a judgmentdeclaring the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization invalid. Zionsville filed a counterclaimseeking a judicial declaration prohibiting Whitestown from pursuing its attempts to annexterritory (a) in Perry Township because the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization was first-intime,and (b) in Zionsville because Whitestown cannot annex territory within Zionsville'scorporate limits.","On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court entered summary judgment forWhitestown on October 7, 2014. The trial court concluded that: (1) the 2014 Zionsville-PerryReorganization is contrary to the GMA and therefore invalid; (2) the 2014 Zionsville-PerryReorganization's proposal for a public vote on the 2014 Plan does not comply with the GMA; (3)Whitestown has authority to pursue the annexations, and (4) the Town of Whitestown did notbreach the interlocal agreement with the Town of Zionsville. The reorganization plan wasnevertheless to be submitted at the November 4, 2014 general election to the voters of thepolitical subdivisions participating in the reorganization.","Zionsville initiated this appeal, claiming (a) that it possesses township powers from thepredecessor townships of Eagle and Union Townships in the 2010 Reorganization, and thus hasthe power of a township to merge with Perry Township under the GMA; (b) alternatively, that ifZionsville could not reorganize with Perry Township as a township itself, then it couldreorganize with Perry Township as a town; (c) that Whitestown as a municipality cannot annexterritory within Zionsville, a neighboring municipality; (d) that Whitestown cannot annexterritory in Perry Township after the reorganization was initiated; and (e) that the trial court erredin striking down a reorganization between Zionsville and Perry Township ""despite the fact thattheir elected officials and voters both approved the reorganization.""

The principal issue in this appeal is the correctness of the trial court's ruling on theparties' competing summary judgment motions on the same issues. The parties disagreeregarding issues of statutory construction and application, but the relevant facts are not indispute. Because this appeal presents only issues of law, our review is de novo. See Cavens v.Zaberdac, 849 N.E.2d 526, 529 (Ind. 2006).","Consolidating the parties' claims, this appeal presents the following principal issues: (1)Did the 2010 Reorganization of Zionsville with Union and Eagle Townships empower Zionsvilleto subsequently reorganize with Perry Township? (2) Was the 2014 Zionsville-PerryReorganization structurally defective? (3) Was Whitestown entitled to annex territory includedin the proposed 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization or in Zionsville's completed 2010Reorganization?","In 2010 several Boone County government entities reorganized under the GMA. Thereorganization included the ""unincorporated portions of Eagle Township, all of Union Township,and the current Town of Zionsville . . . ."" Appellant's App'x at 0056. The 2010 Reorganizationexcluded the incorporated portion of Eagle Township consisting of portions of the Town ofWhitestown. The reorganization explicitly stated that the resulting governmental entity ""knownas the Town of Zionsville,"" id., ""shall be governed and administered as a 'town' as that term isdefined under Indiana law."" Id. at 0058. In this appeal the parties dispute whether the resultingreorganized Zionsville was thereafter empowered to further reorganize with other townshipsunder the GMA.","We must determine whether Zionsville, as a new political subdivision that identifies itselfas a town and claims township powers, is authorized to further reorganize with another townshipunder the GMA. The Indiana General Assembly enacted the GMA in 2006 expressly designatingamong its purposes to: ""[g]rant broad powers to enable political subdivisions to operate more efficiently by eliminating restrictions under existing law that: (A) impede the economy ofoperation of; (B) interfere with the ease of administration of; (C) inhibit cooperation among; and(D) thwart better government by; political subdivisions."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-1-1(1) (2006). 3Under the GMA, eleven various sets of political subdivisions are authorized to reorganize,including:  (2) Two (2) or more townships located entirely within the same county. A townshipreorganizing under this subdivision must be adjacent to at least one (1) other townshipparticipating in the reorganization.* * *(7) A township and a municipality that is located in any part of the same township.  Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-1(a). In prescribing the powers of a resulting governmental entity, the Actexpressly declared:  A reorganized political subdivision has the powers granted by statute to a politicalsubdivision of the same type as the reorganized political subdivision. However, ifauthorized by the plan of reorganization approved by the voters in a public questionunder this chapter, the reorganized political subdivision will exercise a power or have theofficers or number of offices that a statute would have permitted any of the reorganizingpolitical subdivisions to have.  Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-38. An expansive application of the GMA is expressly directed:""[T]o the extent the provisions of this article are inconsistent with the provisions of any othergeneral, special, or local law, the provisions of this article are controlling, and compliance withthis article shall be treated as compliance with the conflicting law."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-1-6.4The GMA instructs that its provisions must be ""liberally construed to effect [its] purposes . . . .""Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-1-5.","In 2012 this Court extensively reviewed the nature and effect of the GMA, finding that it was enacted in 2006 to liberalize ""the framework within which local governments mayreorganize themselves."" Kole v. Faultless, 963 N.E.2d 493, 494 (Ind. 2012). The GMAframework ""substantially reduces the barriers to rearranging local units"" id, and granted politicalsubdivisions ""'full and complete authority' to reorganize, exercise governmental functions undera cooperative agreement, and transfer responsibilities between offices and officers."" Id at 496.Under the GMA, ""[a] reorganization includes a change in the structure or administration of apolitical subdivision . . . ."" Id. We emphasized in Kole that, regardless of the politicalsubdivisions involved in a reorganization, the GMA ""does not, at least by its terms, limit theresulting forms the reorganized political subdivision may take."" Id. at 497. Kole furtherexplained that, because the GMA specifically directs that it be liberally construed and fullyauthorizes the reorganization of political subdivisions, ""nontraditional"" political subdivisionsmay emerge after reorganization. See Kole, 963 N.E.2d at 495 (approving a new politicalsubdivision, the City of Fishers, which ""would become a 'nontraditional' second class city thatcombined attributes of a second class city and a town"").","The 2010 Reorganization plan expressly directed that Zionsville, as the resulting entity,was to be governed and administered as a town under Indiana law. Thus it had the powersgranted by statute to a town. Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-38(a). In addition to these powers the GMAauthorized a reorganized political subdivision to ""exercise a power . . . that a statute would havepermitted any of the organizing political subdivisions to have"" but only ""if authorized by the planof reorganization approved by the voters in a public question under this chapter . . . ."" Id. The2010 Reorganization plan specified that the powers of the resulting Town of Zionsville5 wouldinclude the ""powers, rights, and duties"" of Eagle and Union Townships as follows:  Township Duties Transferred. As of the Effective Date, the offices described in Ind. Code_ 36-6 et. seq., including, but not limited to, the township trustee and the township board,shall cease to exist and are abolished, and the powers, rights, and duties described in Ind.Code _ 36-6 et. seq. shall be transferred in the manner set forth herein or asdetermined by the New Town Council.  Joint Resolution No. 2008-02 of the Eagle Township Board, Joint Resolution No. 2008-01 of theUnion Township Board, Ordinance No. 2008-12 of the Town of Zionsville, Indiana, 6-7 (Appellant's App'x at 0060) (emphasis added). Whitestown does not dispute the adoption of thisjoint resolution nor the approval of the 2010 Reorganization by a majority of the voters.","As noted above, the GMA provision authorizing a reorganized government entity toexercise the powers of the organizing entities is qualified by the phrase ""if authorized by the planof reorganization . . . ."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-38. Whitestown argues that under the language ofthe 2010 Reorganization plan the powers transferred to Zionsville included only ""the powers,rights, and duties described in Ind. Code _ 36-6 et seq."" Appellee's Br. at 21 (quotingAppellant's App'x at 0298) (emphasis in original). The provisions of Title 36, Article 6(Government of Townships) do not include the specific power to reorganize as a township foundin the GMA at Title 36, Article 1.5 (Government Modernization). Significantly, however, theGMA directs its own expansive and controlling application:  A political subdivision may exercise the powers granted under this article to reorganizeor enter into cooperative agreements without complying with the provisions of any otherlaw, statute, or rule.  Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-1-4. The Act further states: ""This article shall be liberally construed to effectthe purposes of this article."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-1-5. Similarly:  Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, to the extent the provisions of thisarticle are inconsistent with the provisions of any other general, special, or local law, theprovisions of this article are controlling, and compliance with this article shall be treatedas compliance with the conflicting law.  Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-1-6. As explained in Kole, the GMA granted political subdivisions ""'full andcomplete authority'"" to reorganize and exercise governmental functions. 963 N.E.2d at 496(citing Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-1-2). In Kole, this Court also reviewed Indiana's history relating tothe powers local government had as being limited to only those powers specifically listed, andhow the General Assembly has been actively moving away from that limitation since the 1970'sand into the Twenty-First Century. Id. at 496. We observed:  [I]t is far less burdensome on both the courts and the Legislature for the law to presumethe existence of local authority to act absent some express prohibition, than it is to requirelegislation spelling out every detail of every permissible action a municipality may take.So the General Assembly has said, several times over multiple recent decades.  Kole, 963 N.E.2d at 498. In light of these considerations, we decline to restrictively interpret theGMA's application to the 2010 Reorganization plan so as to limit Zionsville's exercise of generaltownship powers, including the power to further reorganize pursuant to the GMA.","We acknowledge the vigorous arguments of Whitestown cautioning against potentialchallenges related to traditional concepts of governance and the allocation and assumption oftownship services, particularly with respect to the Whitestown residents located in the formerEagle Township. Issues of effective municipal governance are policy matters to be determinedby legislative formulation, not by judicial intrusion. We conclude that the legislature, in craftingthe GMA, envisioned and authorized reorganized political entities to assume all of the functionsand to exercise all of the powers of the entities participating in the reorganization. Thisunderstanding is enhanced by the legislature's later declaration that ""a reorganized politicalsubdivision that results from a reorganization under this chapter must continue to carry out theduties imposed by Indiana law on the reorganizing political subdivisions that combined to formthe reorganized political subdivision."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-39(b) (2013).","Whitestown also argues that the GMA ""permits two adjacent 'townships' to reorganizetogether,"" but ""does not permit a township and a town with some township powers to do so.""Appellee's Br. at 20 (citing Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-1(a)(2)) (emphasis in original). This is because,Whitestown argues, ""the Legislature did not say that a municipality with 'substantially equivalentpowers' to a township could reorganize as if it were a township."" Id. at 20 n.4. We reject thisargument because the ability to reorganize under section 36-1.5-4-1(a)(2) is itself a townshippower_specifically the power to ""reorganize under this chapter."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-1(a). Asexplained above, the GMA expressly authorizes a reorganized political subdivision to ""exercise apower . . . that a statute would have permitted any of the reorganizing political subdivisions tohave."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-38.","The fact that the reorganized Town of Zionsville included all of Eagle Township exceptportions within the municipal boundaries of Whitestown does not preclude the transfer toZionsville of all of the township powers of the former Eagle Township. Whitestown concedesthat ""[n]o one disputes that Zionsville is required to provide township services in all of theformer Eagle Township and that [it] possesses the power to do so."" Appellee's Br. at 23. Wefind that the GMA authorized the transfer of all township powers from Eagle and UnionTownships to the resulting 2010 reorganized Zionsville. We conclude that the township powers of Eagle and Union Townships, including the power to reorganize with another township underthe GMA, were transferred to the reorganized Town of Zionsville as a result of the 2010Reorganization, enabling Zionsville to seek further government reorganization under the GMA.","The GMA provides that, in order for two townships to reorganize into one political entity,they ""must be adjacent."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-1(a)(2). The GMA further explains thisrequirement: ""[T]wo (2) political subdivisions may not be treated as adjacent if the politicalsubdivisions are connected by a strip of land that is less than one hundred fifty (150) feet wide.""Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-2.","Prior to its 2010 Reorganization Zionsville was entirely located within Eagle Township.In 2010, however, it reorganized to include all the unincorporated areas of Eagle and UnionTownships. The only area within the two Townships excluded from this reorganization was partof the Town of Whitestown within Eagle Township, which was the only incorporated area insuch townships (besides the Town of Zionsville). Before the 2010 Reorganization, a portion ofthe Town of Whitestown was located between Zionsville and Perry Township. While themunicipal limits of Whitestown included land along a significant portion of the west border ofEagle Township, Whitestown did not include a small rectangular parcel at the southwest cornerof the former Eagle Township that, for a distance of over 1300 feet, shared a common boundarywith Perry Township. While a portion of Whitestown separated this small parcel from the rest ofZionsville, the parcel was itself an unincorporated part of the former Eagle Township and thusunder the 2010 Zionsville reorganization became a part of the resulting reorganized Town ofZionsville. This small parcel is the only territory included in the 2010 Reorganization that isadjacent to Perry Township, and it serves as the basis for the reorganized Town of Zionsville'sclaim that it satisfies the GMA requirement that reorganizing townships must be adjacent.6 Thefollowing graphic prepared by the Court depicts the location of the small parcel in relation to the boundaries of Perry Township, Whitestown, and the main body of Zionsville.","While we do not find a separate legal description for the parcel in the record, the mapsaccompanying the 2010 Reorganization identified it as part of the rural, unincorporated territoryof Eagle Township included in the reorganization. In 2014 Whitestown sought to annex aspecifically identified seventy acre area, which included this small parcel of formerlyunincorporated Eagle Township now a part of Zionsville. Whitestown thereby implicitlyacknowledged that this sub-parcel was not already a part of Whitestown and identified it aslocated in the former Eagle Township. This former Eagle Township parcel coincides with theparcel of unincorporated Eagle Township territory included in the 2010 Reorganization plan.From the legal description of the seventy acres sought to be annexed by Whitestown, it is clearthat the small parcel of reorganized Zionsville was adjacent to Perry Township for a distance ofat least 1300 feet.","Whitestown, however, urges that governmental reorganization under the GMA should notbe applied to permit a municipality to be comprised of separated parcels, emphasizing that the2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization would result in Zionsville being divided into twogeographical territories separated by a portion of Whitestown. While not disputing that the smallparcel adjoins Perry Township for more than 150 feet, Whitestown argues that the parcel ""is not contiguous with the remainder of [reorganized] Zionsville and may not form a basis forestablishing adjacency"" because it is separated by Whitestown. Appellee's Br. at 29.Whitestown contends that permitting Zionsville to reorganize with Perry Township based ontheir common border for more than 150 feet allows Zionsville, or any other municipality, to use apreviously acquired ""small, isolated, island of land"" as a ""springboard to extend its municipalboundaries to an area entirely separated"" from the rest of its territory by another municipality.Appellee's Br. at 30. Whitestown urges that the GMA adjacency requirement should beinterpreted to prohibit ""leap-frogging,"" Appellee's Pet. to Tr. at 12, which is contrary to the ""ideaof a municipal corporation . . . [] that of oneness, community, locality, vicinity; a collective bodyof inhabitants_that is, a body of people collected or gathered together in one mass, notseparated into distinct masses . . ."" Appellee's Br. at 30 (quoting Town of Dyer v. Town of St.John, 919 N.E.2d 1196, 1202 (Ind. Ct. App. 2010)) (emphasis added by Appellee); see alsoAmici Batesville's Br. at 7. From its statutory language, however, the GMA clearly permits thereorganization of political subdivisions that are ""adjacent"" in the sense that they are ""connectedby a strip of land that is [not] less than one hundred fifty (150) feet wide."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-2. The GMA does not mandate that a reorganized political subdivision be wholly interconnectedwithout physical separation. Because the parcel in the southwest corner of reorganizedZionsville provides over 150 feet of adjacency to Perry Township, the GMA's adjacencyrequirement is satisfied.","In its reply brief in support of petition to transfer, Whitestown also asks us to import arequirement that certain annexed territory be ""contiguous"" under Indiana Code _ 36-4-3-1.5.Because this issue was raised for the first time in two cursory sentences in Whitestown's replybrief to petition to transfer, we deem it waived. State v. Holtsclaw, 977 N.E.2d 348, 350-51 (Ind.2012) (citing Ind. App. R. 48(A)(8)(a)); Ind. App. R. 57(G). Notwithstanding waiver, however,we disapprove the argument. In this claim, Whitestown argues that the GMA in sections 36-1.5-4-37 and 36-1.5-4-39 imports from the statutory provisions governing annexation therequirement that a territory being annexed be ""contiguous,"" that is, ""at least one-eighth (1/8) ofthe aggregate external boundaries of the territory"" being annexed must ""coincide[] with theboundaries of the annexing municipality."" Ind. Code _ 36-4-3-1.5 (1981). Those GMA sections,however, do not apply here. Whitestown's rights are not affected by either the 2014 Zionsville Perry Reorganization or the 2010 Reorganization. See Ind. Code __ 36-1.5-4-1(b)(3), -38(c)(2013). Neither of Zionsville's reorganizations presents any incursion into the municipalboundaries of Whitestown and thus do not substantively impair Whitestown's rights. In adoptingthe GMA in 2006, the legislature chose to require only 150 feet of adjacency, Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-2, not the contiguity required for annexation, Ind. Code _ 36-4-3-1.5. We decline tojudicially superimpose on the GMA the contiguity requirements of the statutory annexationprocedure.","It is undisputed that the small parcel, which was part of the unincorporated area of EagleTownship before the 2010 Reorganization, thereafter became part of the resulting reorganizedgovernmental entity known as the Town of Zionsville. We thus conclude that reorganizedZionsville, acting with the powers of a township transferred to it in the 2010 Reorganization, wasadjacent to Perry Township by more than 150 feet in 2014 and thereby was eligible to reorganizewith Perry Township under the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan.","Because we find that Zionsville, in the exercise of township powers transferred to it as aresult of the 2010 Reorganization plan, is authorized to seek further reorganization under theGMA, we decline to address Zionsville's alternative claim that, in addition to its power to actwith the powers of a township, it may also reorganize with Perry Township under its town statusas a municipality under Indiana Code Section 36-1.5-4-1(a)(7),7 which does not require that thetwo entities be adjacent to each other, but rather that the municipality be ""located in any part ofthe same township."" Zionsville argues that following its 2010 Reorganization it became a part ofPerry Township as the least-populated, contiguous township to itself under Indiana Code _ 36-6-1-12 (1993),8 and thus, if found to lack the powers of a township to further reorganize, couldalternatively reorganize with Perry Township as a municipality within the township. We neednot consider this alternative argument.","Whitestown also challenges the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization on grounds that theplan's voting areas do not comply with GMA requirements. In a reorganization under IndianaCode _ 36-1.5-4-1(a)(2), the GMA requires that a ""majority of the voters in each reorganizingpolitical subdivision"" must ""approve . . . the reorganization."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-32(a) (2013).Whitestown argues that the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization failed to satisfy the followingstatutory requirement:  If a reorganizing political subdivision includes the territory of another reorganizingpolitical subdivision, the vote of voters of a reorganizing political subdivision who alsoare voters in a second reorganizing political subdivision that is geographically larger thanthe first political subdivision and that includes the territory of the first politicalsubdivision shall be included only in the tally of votes for the first reorganizing politicalsubdivision in which the voters reside.  Ind. Code _36-1.5-4-32(a) (2013).9 Whitestown urges that this provision requires a separatevoting tally for voters in each of the former townships and municipalities that comprised the2010 Reorganization. We disagree.  ","As applied to the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization, the phrase ""each reorganizingpolitical subdivision,"" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-32(a), includes only two units: the reorganizingportions of Perry Township10 and the previously reorganized Town of Zionsville. These tworeorganizing units do not overlap, and thus the GMA provision regarding territory situated inmore than one reorganizing political subdivision is not applicable. See Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-32(a) (2013).11 The 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan is not invalid because of itsfailure to require a separate voting tally for each of the political subdivisions participating in the 2010 Reorganization.","Whitestown does not dispute that the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan wassubmitted to the voters of Zionsville and the reorganizing portions of Perry Township, but ratherit claims (in addition to asserting that voting blocs must be separately tallied as discussed above)that the resulting election was meaningless because it occurred after the trial court's orderdeclaring the reorganization and its voting areas to be invalid.","While ruling that Zionsville and Perry Township cannot reorganize and that the 2014Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan was invalid, the trial court did not order removal of thereorganization question from the ballot. On October 7, 2014, the same day that the trial courtorder was issued, Zionsville filed its motion to stay the order and allow the November 4th ballotquestion on the reorganization, but the trial court denied the stay. Whitestown did not seek, andthe trial court did not order, removal of the question from the November 4, 2014 general ballot.Whitestown explained: ""The Perry Plan is already on the ballots, voters are already voting on it,and Whitestown has not moved to have it removed because it is impossible to do so given thatearly voting has already begun."" Appellant's App'x at 0681. Whitestown now contends that theNovember vote on the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization is ""meaningless"" because voterscannot ""approve an illegal and void public question"" as a matter of law. Appellee's Br. at 41. Inaddition, Whitestown suggests that the election results are unreliable because the trial court'sdecision invalidating the reorganization may have minimized election participation from voterswho might otherwise have voted ""no"" on the ballot question.","The effect of the 2014 general election vote on the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganizationwas not an issue in the summary judgment proceedings in the trial court. The election occurred one month after the trial court issued the ruling on appeal. Details regarding the electionadministration and results are not presented in any of the designated evidence. The facts andcircumstances of this election arose after the entry of the trial court order that is the subject ofthis appeal. The effect of the trial court judgment on the ensuing 2014 general electionreorganization plan vote is not before this Court for resolution in this appeal.","In granting Whitestown's motion for summary judgment, the trial court not only foundthe 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization to be invalid but also concluded that neither the 2010nor the 2014 Zionsville reorganizations, even if valid, prohibited Whitestown's annexations.The trial court authorized Whitestown to proceed with annexations not only as to territory withinthe 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization but also as to territory within the 2010 Reorganization.Zionsville challenges these determinations on appeal, alternatively arguing (a) that Indiana lawprohibits annexations by one municipality within the borders of another, and (b) that Whitestownfailed to timely initiate the proposed annexations.","A resolution authorizing Zionsville and Perry Township to participate in a proposedreorganization was passed on April 18, 2014 by the Perry Township Trustee and the PerryTownship Advisory Board and on April 21, 2014 by the Zionsville Town Council. The next day,April 22, 2014, four proposed annexation resolutions were introduced at the Whitestown TownCouncil. Two of the proposed Whitestown annexations involved only Perry Township territoryincluded in the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization, one included only territory within theboundaries of Zionsville as reorganized in 2010, and one included territory both fromZionsville's 2010 Reorganization and from the proposed 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization.13The 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan was finally adopted by Zionsville and Perry Township on May 20, 2014.","Zionsville and Whitestown dispute whether the Whitestown annexation proceedings areprohibited under Indiana's statutory municipal annexation statutes that declare ""a municipalitymay not annex territory that is inside the corporate boundaries of another municipality. . . ."" Ind.Code _ 36-4-3-2 (1980) (emphasis added). Whitestown argues that (a) Zionsville should not beconsidered ""another municipality"" because it ""has been acting as a township"" rather than a townsince its 2010 Reorganization, and (b) the annexation statutes defer to the GMA provisionpermitting annexation of territory within a township after the lapse of a time period that hasoccurred. Appellee's Br. at 54-55.","The 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan expressly declared that, upon approval ofthe plan, the resulting reorganized political subdivision ""shall be known as the Town ofZionsville, a municipality."" Appellant's App'x at 0350. Under the plan, all of the unincorporatedterritory in the former Perry Township included in the reorganization was to become a part of thenew municipality of Zionsville and to be included within its corporate boundaries. We find thatthe subsequent exercise of township powers by Zionsville as authorized by the GMA does notchange its status from a town to a township, nor does such exercise of township powers diminishits protection as a municipality under Indiana Code Section 36-4-3-2 from invasive annexations.All territory within reorganized Zionsville, including the former Perry, Eagle, and UnionTownship territories, whether through the 2010 Reorganization or through the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization, would thereby fall within the new corporate boundaries of reorganizedZionsville and thus be shielded from annexation by Indiana Code Section 36-4-3-2.","Whitestown asserts that its right to annex is governed instead by a new provision in Indiana's municipal annexation statutes that, as applied to the present parties, provides: ""If atownship is a participant in a proposed reorganization . . . , a municipality may not adopt anannexation ordinance annexing territory within the township within the period set forth in IC 36-1.5-4-45."" Ind. Code _ 36-4-3-1.4 (2013) (emphasis added). Whitestown observes that this timeperiod ""had already elapsed,"" Appellee's Br. at 55, thus implying that all the annexations mayproceed. This municipal annexation time period references a time period in a corollary provisionin the GMA, which provides in relevant part:  (b) A political subdivision may not take any of the following actions partially or whollywithin a reorganizing political subdivision after the date on which a plan ofreorganization is finally adopted by all reorganizing political subdivisions unless allreorganizing political subdivisions agree by adopting identical resolutions:(1) Initiate an annexation of territory.(2) Establish a fire protection territory or fire protection district.(3) Extend water, sewer, or any other infrastructure to the political subdivision.(4) Expand zoning jurisdiction under IC 36-7-4-205.* * *(e) If a reorganization is approved by the voters under section 34 of this chapter,15 apolitical subdivision may not take an action under subsection (b) until the earlier of thefollowing:(1) The plan of reorganization has been implemented.(2) One (1) year after the date on which the reorganization is approved undersection 34 of this chapter.  Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-45 (2013) (emphasis added). Thus the interim prohibition of annexation ofterritory in townships participating in a proposed GMA reorganization, Indiana Code Section 36-4-3-1.4, would expire upon the implementation of a GMA reorganization or one year after thedate of its approval by voters, whichever is earlier. Section 1.4 is not limited to the initiation ofannexation attempts, but explicitly prohibits any final adoption of ""an annexation ordinanceannexing territory within the township. . . ."" Ind. Code _ 36-4-3-1.4 (2013).","In the present case, Perry Township became a participant in a proposed reorganizationwith Zionsville on April 21, 2014, when both Zionsville and Perry Township had adoptedreciprocal resolutions to prepare a plan of reorganization. Such plan was finally adopted by the reorganizing political subdivisions on May 20, 2014 and was to be submitted to the voters in thereorganizing political subdivisions in the general election of November 4, 2014.16 The planspecified an effective date of January 1, 2015. Assuming its approval in the 2014 generalelection, the interim prohibition on annexation of territory in a reorganizing township expiredJanuary 1, 2015, the plan's implementation date. Whitestown is correct that the interimprohibition against its annexation of Perry Township territory elapsed. But Whitestown does notclaim that it thereafter completed the adoption of any of its disputed annexation ordinancesannexing territory in Perry Township or in reorganized Zionsville. To the contrary, PerryTownship became a part of the municipality of Zionsville on the 2014 Zionsville-PerryReorganization plan's effective date of January 1, 2015. From that point forward, Indiana CodeSection 36-4-3-2 protected it from Whitestown's attempted annexations.","We conclude that Section 36-4-3-2 of the municipal annexation statutes prohibitsWhitestown (a) from annexing territory within former townships reorganized with the Town ofZionsville in 2010 and (b) from annexing territory in Perry Township included in the 2014Zionsville-Perry Reorganization.","Notwithstanding such prohibitions against annexation, however, Whitestown argues thatfirst-in-time principles allow it to complete its 2014 proposed annexations. As this Court haslong held, ""[t]he first-in-time jurisdictional rule applies 'when there exist two tribunalspossessing concurrent and complete jurisdiction of a subject-matter.'"" Brenwick Assocs., LLC v.Boone Cty. Redev. Comm'n., 889 N.E.2d 289, 294 (Ind. 2008) (quoting Taylor v. City of Ft.Wayne, 47 Ind. 274, 282 (Ind. 1874)). Whitestown specifically argues that because it ""initiatedits annexations when it introduced the ordinances at a public council meeting [on April 22, 2014]. . . . it had exclusive authority to proceed on them, and neither [the GMA] nor the Perry Plan prevented its annexations."" Appellee's Br. at 45. Zionsville argues alternatively that (a) the mereintroduction of the annexation ordinances was insufficient to initiate exclusive jurisdiction underthe first-in-time rule, and (b) even if Whitestown did initiate its annexations, ""Perry Townshipand Zionsville took the steps necessary to initiate the Perry Reorganization before Whitestowneven introduced its annexation ordinance."" Appellant's Br. at 41 (emphasis in original). Theparties thus dispute what constitutes an ""initiation"" under the first-in-time rule, and which partywas first to initiate.","It is undisputed that Perry Township and Zionsville both resolved to pursuereorganization on April 18, 2014, and April 21, 2014, respectively, and that annexationordinances were introduced at the Whitestown Town Council meeting on April 22, 2014. As toPerry Township and Zionsville, the point in time of ""initiation"" is resolved by the GMA itself,which declares, ""[t]he legislative body of a political subdivision may initiate a proposedreorganization under this chapter by adopting a resolution that: (1) proposes a reorganization;and (2) names the political subdivisions that would be reorganized in the proposedreorganization."" Ind. Code _ 36-1.5-4-10(a) (2013) (emphasis added). The resolutions ofZionsville and Perry Township meet these requirements. The resolution adopted by Zionsvillewas titled ""A Resolution of the Zionsville Town Council to Participate in the ProposedReorganization with Perry Township. . . ."" Appellant's App'x at 0344. That resolution alsonoted that ""the Board of Perry Township unanimously adopted Resolution No. 2014-01 on April18, 2014 proposing a reorganization with the Town [of Zionsville] . . . ."" Id. (emphasis added).Zionsville's Town Council further resolved that ""the Town of Zionsville and Perry Township . . .shall reorganize and/or enter into a cooperative agreement"" and that ""[t]he legislative bodies ofPerry Township and the Town of Zionsville shall prepare a plan of reorganization . . . ."" Id. Thisresolution recognized Perry Township's proposal of reorganization, resolved to participate in thatreorganization, and specifically identified at several points that the reorganizing entities wereZionsville and Perry Township.","Whitestown argues that the resolution did not initiate reorganization because ""Zionsvilleand Perry Township had not resolved to reorganize because they were alternatively pursuing a cooperative agreement."" Appellee's Br. at 49 (emphasis in original). The GMA's language isclear, however, that to initiate a reorganization, all that is required is for a political subdivision toadopt a resolution proposing a reorganization and naming the other participating politicalsubdivision(s). The Perry Township/Zionsville resolutions met these requirements, and theincluded alternative option to enter into a cooperative agreement has no bearing under thestatute.17 Thus, regardless of whether the introduction of the proposed annexation ordinances atthe Whitestown Town Council constituted an ""initiation,"" the reorganization of Zionsville andPerry Township was initiated first-in-time.","We therefore conclude that, under the first-in-time rule, Whitestown may not complete itsproposed annexations of territory in the former Eagle Township reorganized with Zionsville in2010, nor complete its proposed annexations of Perry Township territory included in thereorganized Zionsville that results from the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization.","The parties' opposing motions for summary judgment presented the trial court withcompeting claims as to the power of Zionsville to engage with Perry Township in areorganization under the Government Modernization Act, as to the power of Whitestown toannex Perry Township territory within such reorganization, and also as to the power ofWhitestown to annex territory within Zionsville's 2010 Reorganization. These competing claimspresent issues of law, and we now hold that the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization is notprohibited and that Whitestown may not adopt annexation ordinances annexing territory inmunicipalities that are the result of completed reorganizations under the Act. The judgment ofthe trial court is reversed. This cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion."
4,"In August 2012, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Officer Phillip Robinett conducted a routine traffic stop. Upon making the stop, he discovered that the driver, Antonio Garcia, was driving without a valid drivers license. Garcia was lawfully placed under arrest. Before Officer Robinett placed Garcia in his police cruiser to be transported to the police station, he conducted a quick pat-down search of Garcias clothing in order to check for weapons. A cylinder-shaped pill container was found in Garcias pocket. Officer Robinett opened the container to check what it contained. The content was later confirmed to be a single narcotic pill, which Garcia did not have a valid prescription for.","Garcia was charged with driving without a license and possession of a controlled substance. At trial, Garcia sought to suppress the admission of the pill container and its contents as the fruit of an unlawful search under Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution. It was not disputed that Officer Robinett was free to conduct a warrantless pat-down search of Garcias person incident to his arrest. Rather, Garcia only challenged the opening of the pill container as being an unreasonable search.","We disagree with Garcias contention that opening the pill container during the course of the pat-down search incident to his arrest constituted an unreasonable search. As such, we affirm the trial courts denial of Garcias motion to suppress and hold that the search of Garcia incident to his arrest was reasonable under Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution.","On August 6, 2012, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Officer Phillip Robinett observed a vehicle driving without headlights at approximately 9:00 p.m. Officer Robinett turned his police cruiser around to initiate a traffic stop. The vehicle then turned without signaling into a parking spot, even prior to Officer Robinett activating the police cruiser lights and sirens.","Upon approaching the vehicle, Officer Robinett requested a drivers license from the vehicle driver. The driver, who was later identified as Antonio Garcia, only had an identification card from a foreign country. Officer Robinett confirmed that Garcia did not hold a valid drivers license, and he initiated an arrest for driving without a license.","Incident to the arrest, Officer Robinett conducted a pat-down search of Garcia to check for weapons. No weapons were found during the search, but a silver cylinder-shaped container was recovered from Garcias front left pocket. Through his work as a police officer, Officer Robinett had encountered similar containers and recognized that it likely contained either an illegal substance or properly prescribed prescriptions. Upon opening the container, Officer Robinett found a single pill. Garcia was taken into custody, and his vehicle was towed. The cylinder was delivered to the police department property room, and the contents of the container, a single pill, was later submitted to the crime lab for testing. The crime lab report indicated that the pill contained Hydrocodone. Garcia did not have a valid prescription for this medication.","Garcia was charged with possession of a controlled substance1 and with operating a vehicle without a drivers license.2 A bench trial was held. At trial, the defense made a motion to suppress the cylinder container and its contents from being admitted into evidence. The defense asserted that Officer Robinett did not have the authority to open the container, but conceded that the container could have been seized as a search incident to arrest. The State opposed the motion, relying upon U.S. v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973), to argue that opening the container found on Garcias person was a permissible warrantless search incident to arrest.","At trial, Garcia testified that he had been living with his wife, his wifes aunt, and child. Only three days prior to the traffic stop, his wifes aunt had passed away. Garcia explained that the cylinder container was only in his possession because that morning he had been cleaning out the bedroom of his wifes recently deceased Aunt, and he had found the container. He believed it could contain pills, but Garcia never looked inside the container. He had picked it up to keep it out of reach from his young son. Contrary to this account, Officer Robinett testified that after he found the pill inside the container Garcia voluntarily stated that the pill was his 瘫narcotic for pain.台 (Tr. at 29.) There were no other testifying witnesses.","After both the State and Defense rested, defense counsel conceded to the fact that Garcia was driving without a license. Then, the trial court returned to the issue of whether the cylinder container should be suppressed, noting that the Robinson case seemed to be 瘫on point.台 (Tr. at 44.) The defense argued that the contents of the container was not obviously contraband, there was no concern for officer safety, no exigent circumstances, and a warrant could have been obtained if the police wanted to examine the contents of the container.","The court denied the motion to suppress the container, finding Robinson controlling. Garcia was found guilty of possessing a controlled substance and driving while never receiving a license. Garcia was sentenced to 180 days in Marion County jail with 176 days suspended.","Garcia appealed, asserting that the search of the container was outside the scope of a permissible search incident to arrest and was unreasonable under Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution. The Court of Appeals agreed with Garcia. Garcia v. State, 25 N.E.3d 786 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015). In reaching this decision, the court applied the Litchfield v. State, 824 N.E.2d 356, 361 (Ind. 2005), factors 瘫to the search of the container.台 Id. at 790. The court reasoned that the degree of suspicion that a criminal violation had occurred was low, both arguments about the degree of intrusion were meritorious, and the need of law enforcement was also low given that there was no concern for officer safety or suspicion of criminal activity. Id. Thus, it was unreasonable to open the container found in Garcias pocket during a search incident to arrest. Id. at 791. The pill was inadmissible, and Garcias conviction for class D felony possession of a schedule III controlled substance was reversed. Id.","This Court granted the States petition for transfer, thereby vacating the Court of Appeals opinion. Ind. Appellate Rule 58(a). We affirm the trial courts denial of Garcias motion to suppress. We hold that the search of the container found on Garcias person was within the scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest and was reasonable under Article 1, Section 11.","The standard of review for a trial courts ruling on a motion to suppress is similar to other sufficiency issues. Litchfield, 824 N.E.2d at 358 (internal citation omitted). 瘫We determine whether substantial evidence of probative value exists to support the trial courts ruling.台 Id. Evidence will not be reweighed, and we 瘫consider conflicting evidence most favorably to the trial courts ruling.台 Id. However, this Court reviews de novo a trial courts ruling on the constitutionality of a search or seizure. Belvedere v. State, 889 N.E.2d 286, 287 (Ind. 2008) (internal citation omitted).","Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution reads: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search or seizure, shall not be violated; and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and person or thing to be seized.  This Section has long served to protect Hoosiers from unreasonable searches and seizures. Reasonableness of a search under the Indiana Constitution 瘫turns on an evaluation of the reasonableness of the police conduct under the totality of the circumstances.台 Litchfield, 824 N.E.2d at 361 (citing Moran v. State, 644 N.E.2d 536, 539 (Ind. 1994)) (emphasis added). In considering the totality of the circumstances, the perspectives of both the investigating officer and subject of the search are considered. Litchfield, 824 N.E.2d at 360. Three factors must be balanced: 瘫1) the degree of concern, suspicion, or knowledge that a violation has occurred, 2) the degree of intrusion the method of the search or seizure imposes on the citizens ordinary activities, and 3) the extent of law enforcement needs.台 Id. at 361.","In considering the three Litchfield factors, the context in which the search occurs is highly relevant. As early as 1914, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the validity of a search incident to a lawful arrest, noting that the government has 瘫always recognized under English and American law台 that it is permissible 瘫to search the person of the accused when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime.台 Weeks v. U.S., 232 U.S. 383, 392 (1914). Likewise, Indiana has also recognized that a search may be conducted 瘫without a warrant if it is incidental to a lawful arrest.台 Townsend v. State, 460 N.E.2d 139, 141 (Ind. 1984). In the present case, it is not disputed that Garcia was searched incident to a valid arrest.","The question before the Court today goes beyond the general acceptance that a warrantless search incident to a valid arrest is reasonable under both the Fourth Amendment and Article 1, Section 11. Garcia does not dispute that the search of his person was permissible as a search incident to arrest. Rather, he challenges the permissible scope of such a search. Garcia contends that while the pill container found on his person during the pat-down search could be seized, a search incident to arrest under Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution does not permit the officer to open the container found on his person without a warrant or reasonable suspicion of illegal activity. After consideration of the three Litchfield factors and federal precedent on this very issue, we disagree. In the present case, opening the container found on Garcias person during the course of a search incident to a valid arrest was reasonable under the Indiana Constitution.","As recited above, the reasonableness of a search requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances, which is done by balancing the three Litchfield factors. Although Garcia puts great emphasis upon the lack of suspicion surrounding the search of the container itself, the degree of suspicion is but one factor to be considered. Additionally, these factors must be considered in light of the fact that the search occurred in the context of a search incident to a lawful arrest, and this Court has long recognized that 瘫[a] search incident to a valid arrest is lawful regardless of what it reveals.台 Farrie v. State, 251 Ind. 681, 683, 266 N.E.2d 212, 214 (1971). We address each factor in turn.","This factor may be assessed quickly and ultimately falls in favor of the State. We have previously recognized that 瘫once a lawful arrest has been made, authorities may conduct a 跳full search of the arrestee for weapons or concealed evidence. No additional probable cause for the search is required, and the search incident to arrest may 跳involve a relatively extensive exploration of the person.台 Edwards v. State, 759 N.E.2d 626, 629 (Ind. 2001) (citing Robinson, 414 U.S. at 227, 235) (internal quotation and citation omitted). In the present situation, we read Edwards to support the conclusion that Officer Robinett did not need any additional degree of suspicion specifically in relation to the cylinder container found on Garcia in order to open that container incident to Garcias lawful arrest.","Furthermore, as Edwards demonstrates, we have seen fit to consider Robinson on prior occasions when addressing searches incident to arrest. We continue to be persuaded by Robinson regarding the degree of suspicion necessary to conduct a search incident to arrest. The United States Supreme Court set out a clear standard in Robinson. 瘫A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion . . . that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.台 414 U.S. at 235. We similarly conclude that it is 瘫the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search.台3 Id.","Here, Garcia was lawfully placed under arrest for driving his vehicle without a valid drivers license. It is not disputed that the pat-down search of his person incident to his arrest was permissible. Under these circumstances, it is likewise true that no additional suspicion was needed to search the container found in Garcias pocket during the normal course of the pat-down search. Again, as provided in Edwards, once a lawful arrest occurs, no additional probable cause is necessary to conduct a 瘫relatively extensive exploration of the person.台 759 N.E.2d at 629 (internal citations omitted). Thus, the degree of suspicion weighs in favor of the State.","Next, we consider the degree to which the search intruded upon Garcias ordinary activities. In doing so, we continue to look to the totality of the circumstances. First, Garcia had already been subjected to a traffic stop. He was then lawfully arrested, at which time Officer Robinett decided to take him into custody and have his vehicle towed. The brief delay needed to conduct a pat-down search prior to Garcia being taken into custody would have had little to no additional impact on Garcias ordinary activities, given that he was already being placed under arrest. The arrest alone was a significant intrusion into Garcias ordinary activities. A pat-down is minimally intrusive in comparison to Garcia being detained, transported to the police station, booked, and held in jail while criminal charges are potentially brought against him.","Second, even if the pat-down were considered in isolation, we similarly conclude that the search was minimally intrusive. In Edmond v. State, the Court of Appeals addressed the reasonableness of a search that occurred after a driver was arrested for not having a valid license. 951 N.E.2d 585, 587 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001). The police officer planned to have the vehicle towed, and he asked the driver to exit the vehicle. Id. At all times, the driver was cooperative and did not make any threats or furtive movements. Id. The officer conducted a pat-down search of the driver and felt a bulge in his pocket. Id. The officer believed that the bulge could be marijuana, and upon removing the item, discovered a baggie containing a substance that was later confirmed to be marijuana. Id. As a result, the driver was subsequently charged with possession of marijuana. Id.","In affirming the reasonableness of the search under Article 1, Section 11, the court conceded that 瘫the search of a persons body is a substantial intrusion.台 Id. at 592. However, 瘫a police officer is authorized to conduct a thorough search of an arrestee,台 and where the police carry out 瘫only a pat-down search of [an arrestees] clothing . . . the degree of intrusion [is] minimal . . . .台 Id.","Moreover, the degree of intrusion in the present case is easily distinguishable from the unreasonable search in Edwards, 759 N.E.2d at 629. Edwards involved the strip search of an arrestee, who had not been charged with any criminal activity, and any charges he potentially faced were all for nonviolent misdemeanor offenses. Id. After considering the highly intrusive nature of being strip searched, the Court concluded that 瘫[w]e do not believe that routine, warrantless strip searches of misdemeanor arrestees, even when incident to lawful arrests, are reasonable . . . .台 Id. Edwards exemplifies when a search may be deemed unreasonable and outside the scope of a valid search incident to an arrest.","Garcia attempts to argue that only the opening of the pill container should be considered in conducting the reasonableness analysis, and goes on to claim that a pill container is especially private, making the intrusion in opening the container great. We are not persuaded. As Edmond and Edwards demonstrate, it is the type of search, and all of the attendant circumstances, which is relevant to assessing the degree of intrusion. In addition to our own precedent, this conclusion is also supported by the United States Supreme Court, which has directly provided that: A police officers determination as to how and where to search the person of a suspect whom he has arrested is necessarily a quick ad hoc judgment which the Fourth Amendment does not require to be broken down in each instance into an analysis of each step in the search. Robinson, 414 U.S. at 235 (emphasis added). Again, it is not a single aspect of the search that is considered, but the entirety of the search.","Here, Garcia was already subjected to a lawful arrest. The arrest alone would result in Garcias vehicle being towed and Garcia being detained by police, transported to the police station, booked, and detained at the police station for some additional period of time. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the intrusive nature of an arrest in Terry v. Ohio by explaining that 瘫[a]n arrest is the initial stage of a criminal prosecution . . . and it is inevitably accompanied by future interference with the individuals freedom of movement, whether or not trial or conviction ultimately follows.台 392 U.S. 1, 26 (1968). Thus, a brief pat-down search of Garcias clothing was not an extensive intrusion, especially considering Garcias arrest. See Stark v. State, 960 N.E.2d 887, 892 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012) (explaining that 瘫the degree of intrusion was minimal台 when the defendant 瘫had already been arrested, and [the officer] merely retrieved [the defendants] coat from the vehicle,台 which lead to the discovery of a loaded handgun) (emphasis added). Because the search of Garcia was brief and minimal, the degree of intrusion also weighs in favor of the State.","The needs of law enforcement to conduct a search can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances. Among the most commonly recognized bases for conducting a search includes 瘫ensuring that the arrestee is unarmed, preventing the arrestee from brining contraband into jail, and preventing the destruction of evidence.台 Edmond, 951 N.E.2d at 592. (internal citation omitted). It is not disputed that Officer Robinett was justified in doing a pat-down search for weapons before placing Garcia into his police cruiser. Officer safety is a paramount concern when an arrestee is taken into custody. Moreover, a search incident to arrest is not limited based on 瘫an assumption that persons arrested for the offense of driving while their licenses have been revoked are less likely to possess dangerous weapons than are those arrested for other crimes.台 Robinson, 414 U.S. at 234. Rather, 瘫all custodial arrests [are treated] alike for purposes of search justification.台 Id. at 235.","When the pill container was discovered on Garcias person, it is insignificant that Officer Robinett acknowledged that the container could contain legal or illegal substances or that he did not subjectively view Garcia or the container as dangerous. First, we have continually reiterated that 瘫[a] search incident to a valid arrest is lawful regardless of what it reveals.台 Farrie, 251 Ind. at 683, 266 N.E.2d at 214. Second, the objective reasonableness of the search is controlling, not Officer Robinetts subjective views. Even under a brief stop and frisk, it is well established that the reasonableness of an officers suspicion turns upon whether 瘫the totality of the circumstances presented a particularized and objective basis for the officers belief. . . .台 State v. Keck, 4 N.E.3d 1180, 1184 (Ind. 2014) (internal citation and quotation omitted) (emphasis added). Under an objective standard, we agree that 瘫unknown physical objects may always pose risks, no matter how slight, during the tense atmosphere of a custodial arrest.台 Riley v. California, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2485 (2014). In fact, these risks continue to some extent into the ensuing time thereafter the arrest. For example, a risk may still exist while police are transporting an arrestee to a secure location and during booking of that individual at the police station. See Chambers v. State, 422 N.E.2d 1198, 1203 (Ind. 1981) (upholding the validity of a search incident to arrest, regardless of the fact that the search did not occur at the exact time and place of the arrest, but occurred once the police arrived at the police station with the defendant.)","We also seek to reiterate our recent statement in Guilmette. As background, in Guilmette, the defendant challenged the admission of DNA evidence recovered from his shoe because police arrested him for one crime but seized his shoe to search for evidence of a different crime. 14 N.E.3d 38, 41 (Ind. 2014). The defendant argued that the DNA test was an unreasonable search incident to arrest. Id. After upholding the DNA testing of the shoe, the Court explained the practical rationalization for allowing the search: 瘫[I]t would be extremely cumbersome to require law enforcement to take the 跳belt-and-suspenders approach of applying for an independent warrant anytime they wish to examine or test a piece of evidence they have already lawfully seized.台 Id. at 42. Similarly, we see no basis in the present circumstances why an independent warrant should be required to search an item already lawfully seized.","Thus, we conclude that the final Litchfield factor also weighs in favor of the State. When taking an individual into custody, officer safety is a primary concern. Small and seemingly innocuous items have the potential to pose a threat. We see no reason to delay the officers ability to inspect such items once they have already been lawfully seized.","Although our analysis could conclude here, having found that all three of the Litchfield factors weigh in favor of the State, we find it worth noting other persuasive authority that is consistent with our conclusion.","First, this Court has previously upheld, as a valid search incident to arrest, a search that included opening a closed item found on the person of the arrestee. In Chambers, the defendant abducted, sexually assaulted, and then released his victim only after removing her military identification card from her wallet so he could subsequently harass the victim with threatening phone calls. 422 N.E.2d at 1200. Upon further investigation into this offense, police ultimately arrested the defendant at a local tavern. Id. at 1201. Once at the police station, the defendant was ordered to hand over the contents of his pockets, and his wallet was searched in the hope of discovering the victims military identification card. Id. at 1202. The police instead found a piece of paper with the victims name, telephone number, and address written on it. Id. The search of the defendants wallet was upheld as a valid search incident to arrest. Id. at 1203. Even though the police in Chambers had some degree of suspicion regarding what could have been found in the defendants wallet, the degree of suspicion was not the basis of the Courts holding. Rather, the court provided that 瘫[t]he search of [the defendants] wallet in the instant case was proper since it was searched as part of a search of his person.台 Id. at 1203. 瘫The search was incident to the arrest since the wallet . . . was immediately associated with the person of the [arrestee].台 Id.","We decline to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Similar to Chambers, the container found on Garcias person occurred during a valid search incident to arrest. As such, it was permissible for that container to be opened and the contents examined without going to the extent of obtaining an individual warrant.","Additionally, when addressing Fourth Amendment challenges, Indiana courts have upheld searches incident to arrest in which containers found upon the arrestee have been opened. In Klopfenstein v. State, officers detained and arrested the driver and passengers in a vehicle where multiple weapons were in plain view. 439 N.E.2d 1181, 1184 (Ind. Ct. App. 1982). When the driver was subjected to a pat-down search, a closed Tylenol pill bottle in a clear plastic bag was discovered. Id. The officer removed and opened the Tylenol bottle. Id. Inside, the officer discovered a greenish substance, later identified as hashish. Id. After considering both U.S. Supreme Court and Indiana precedent, the court concluded that the search of the Tylenol bottle was a valid search of the person incident to arrest. Id. at 1188. See also Shirley v. State, 803 N.E.2d 251, 253-54, 256 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004) (upholding the validity of a search incident to arrest when an unlabeled pill bottle was found during the search, and the bottle was opened); and Wilson v. State, 754 N.E.2d 950, 953, 957 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001) (upholding the validity of a search incident to arrest after the defendant was arrested for driving with a suspended license, and the pat-down search resulted in finding, among other things, a cigar box, which was opened and found to contain marijuana).","Finally, the U.S. Supreme Courts clear guidance on this issue in Robinson is also persuasive. In Robinson, police conducted a traffic stop and lawfully arrested the driver for operating a motor vehicle after having his license revoked. 414 U.S. at 220. Incident to this arrest, police conducted a pat-down search of the individuals clothing, at which time an object was felt in the breast pocket of the individuals coat. Id. at 222-23. The officer removed the object and discovered that it was a cigarette packet, but at this point, the officer was still unsure what the packet may contain. Id. at 223. Upon opening the cigarette packet, the officer discovered multiple capsules, which were later determined to be heroin. Id.","The Supreme Court first noted that 瘫a search incident to a lawful arrest is a traditional exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment,台 and encompasses searching the person of the arrestee. Id. at 224. While many reasons support the validity of a search incident to arrest, the Robinson court disagreed with the 瘫suggestion that there must be litigated in each case the issue of whether or not there was present one of the reasons supporting the authority for a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest,台 and declined to find 瘫such a case-by-case adjudication台 necessary. Id. at 235. The authority to search incident to arrest does not depend upon 瘫what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.台 Id. The Court concluded that the arrest gave rise to the authority to search the individual, and 瘫it is of no moment that [the officer] did not indicate any subjective fear of the respondent or that he did not himself suspect that respondent was armed.台 Id. at 236. The discovery of the cigarette packet during the course of the lawful search, 瘫entitled [the officer] to inspect it; and when his inspection revealed the heroin capsules, he was entitled to seize them as fruits, instrumentalities, or contraband probative of criminal conduct.台 Id. (internal quotation and string citation omitted).","Although the federal interpretation of reasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment is not binding upon this Courts reasonableness analysis under Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution, in the present situation, we reach the same conclusion. Under Article 1, Section 11, opening a container found on the person of an arrestee in the course of a search incident to valid arrest will not automatically be deemed unreasonable. In the present case, the search of the container found on Garcias person during the course of a pat-down search was reasonable under Article 1, Section 11.","We affirm the trial courts denial of Garcias motion to suppress the pill container found on his person during a search incident to a valid arrest. In doing so, we hold that the search of Garcias person, which included opening the container, was within the scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest and reasonable under Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution.",,,,,

7,"Leandrew Beasley appeals his convictions for the murder of James Allen, the attempted murder of Gerald Beamon, and unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon. We now grant transfer with respect to a single issue raised by Beasley on appeal: whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Beamons testimony that Allen told Beamon he had shot Beasley the day before Allens murder, on the grounds his statements 瘫had so great a tendency . . . to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability台 such that 瘫a reasonable person in the declarants position would have made [the statement] only if the person believed it to be true,台 as permitted by Indiana Evidence Rule 804(b)(3). We find that it was not error for the trial court to admit Beamons challenged testimony on that basis, and thus affirm.","According to Gerald Beamons testimony, on the evening of August 2, 2012, Leandrew Beasley (a.k.a 瘫Little Rock台) and Beamons cousin, James Allen, got into a fight in a garage; Beasley pulled a gun, Allen made a grab for it, and during the struggle, Beasley was shot in the face once, after which the gun would no longer discharge. Three other men, whom Allen identified as Levi, Little Billy, and 瘫J Rock台 (later identified as Beasleys brother, James), were also present at the altercation; Beamon was not. Allen then spent the night at a hotel room with his girlfriend, Shantell Williams, and the couple checked in under her name. Both Allen and Williams maintained permanent housing at that time; no explanation appears in the record for why they stayed at a hotel that night.","Beasley was treated for a gunshot wound to the face at a nearby hospital that evening, which was described by interviewing police officers as a 瘫graze.台 Tr. at 628. Beasley did not implicate Allen in the shooting, instead stating that he was attacked while walking home. Police found no evidence of the shooting at the location where Beasley claimed he had been attacked.","The next day, Allen and Williams drove to Beamons house. Williams waited in the car while Allen told Beamon about the fight. All three then left together to pick up some of Allens things from his apartment and move them into Williamss apartment, and discovered Allens home had been ransacked. Beamon and Allen also observed bullet holes in Allens front porch. The group then went to Williamss friends house, and Allen showed Beamon pictures of the men present in the garage the night before, including Beasley. Beamon had no prior familiarity with Beasley, and studied the photos for about ten minutes.","Beamon, Allen, and Williams then drove to Williamss apartment. Williams went inside while Allen and Beamon began to unload Allens things onto the sidewalk. Beamon heard what at first he thought were fireworks, but quickly realized were gunshots, and saw three men approaching the vehicle on foot, firing repeatedly. Allen died on the spot. Beamon sustained multiple gunshot wounds, but still managed to flee, call 911, and flag down a passing police car. Beamon told the officer that 瘫Little Rock台 and 瘫J Rock台 were two of the shooters, and he was immediately taken to the hospital. Tr. at 398. After he was hospitalized, he indicated he had recognized Leandrew and James from the photographs Allen had showed him earlier in the day. Police retrieved the photos and returned with three separate photo line-ups, from which Beamon identified Leandrew and James as two of the shooters, and correctly identified who was who based on the information he had previously received from Allen.","Leandrew and James Beasley were subsequently charged with murder and attempted murder, and they were tried jointly.1 The court permitted Beamon to testify_over both defendants repeated hearsay objections_as to what Allen had told Beamon about the altercation between Allen and Leandrew Beasley, as a statement against Allens penal interest under Indiana Evidence Rule 804(b)(3). The jury found Beasley guilty of murder and attempted murder.","Beasley appealed, and our Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed his convictions, finding the admission of this hearsay evidence was erroneous, but harmless. Beasley v. State, 30 N.E.3d 56, 67 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015). The panel found that the admission of Allens hearsay statements were not 瘫facially incriminating台 since Allen only described acts of self-defense, and thus the statements did not qualify for a Rule 804(b)(3) hearsay exception. Id. In support, it discussed Jervis v. State in depth, where this Court found a hearsay statement was properly excluded from admission as a statement against penal interest when it was 瘫uncorroborated, only marginally against penal interest, and only marginally relevant.台 Id. at 65_67 (quoting Jervis v. State, 679 N.E.2d 875, 878_80 (Ind. 1997)). Nevertheless, the panel found this error to be harmless, as there were independent non-hearsay grounds for the conviction, specifically Beamons identification of the Beasley brothers at trial as two of the shooters. Id. at 67.","We now grant transfer on this issue, vacating that portion of the opinion below. Ind. Appellate Rule 58(A). We summarily affirm the remainder of the Court of Appeals decision pursuant to Indiana Appellate Rule 58(A)(2).","瘫Wide discretion is afforded the trial court in ruling on the admissibility and relevancy of evidence.台 Nicholson v. State, 963 N.E.2d 1096, 1099 (Ind. 2012). Our review is thus limited to determining whether the court abused that discretion. Id. An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is 瘫clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances and the error affects a partys substantial rights.台 Clark v. State, 994 N.E.2d 252, 260 (Ind. 2013). We do not reweigh the evidence; rather, 瘫we consider only evidence that is either favorable to the ruling or unrefuted and favorable to the defendant.台 Pierce v. State, 29 N.E.3d 1258, 1264 (Ind. 2015).","Beasley contends it was harmful error to admit Beamons hearsay testimony of Allens statements to him, because: (1) Allens statements described acts of self-defense that would not subject him to any criminal liability, and thus their admission under Rule 804(b)(3) was error; and (2) since this was the States only evidence of Beasleys motive, the error was harmful.","We agree with Beasleys second contention, in principle. 瘫While motive is not an element of the crime, the absence of motive is a significant exculpatory factor . . . .台 Kiefer v. State, 761 N.E.2d 802, 806 (Ind. 2002) (reversing conviction for attempted murder in the absence of any evidence of motive, in part because 瘫an inference is necessary to establish Kiefers intent to kill台). Likewise, the inclusion of evidence of motive is likely a significant incriminating factor in the eyes of the jury. Moreover, we can discern no independent evidence in the record to explain why Beasley would have shot Allen and Beamon aside from Beamons hearsay testimony of the previous nights altercation between Beasley and Allen; thus, the States loss of that evidence would almost certainly have made it more difficult to reach a conviction. Beasley is therefore correct that if this testimony were erroneously admitted, it would be grounds for reversal.","We do not, however, agree with Beasleys first contention, and we find the trial court was within its discretion in ruling that Allens statements were against his interests, such that they were admissible hearsay.Indiana Evidence Rule 804(b)(3) reads, in relevant part:The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness.2. . .(3) Statement Against Interest. A statement that [] a reasonable person in the declarants position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it was so contrary to the declarants proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarants claim against someone else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability . . . .","Although we have not yet had occasion to review the current version of Rule 804(b)(3), we have reviewed prior iterations of this rule, which were substantively the same.3 Most significantly, in Jervis v. State, the defendant wished to introduce hearsay testimony regarding an alternate perpetrator of the murder. 679 N.E.2d at 878. The statements in question were between Tony Floyd and his coworker, Marilyn Molinet; Molinet testified that the morning after the victims body was discovered, Floyd told her that:[H]e had gone out 瘫partying台 two nights earlier (the same night [the victim] was killed), picked up a woman at Frenchies, gone 瘫riding around台 with her, and then 瘫dumped her off台 behind Newburgh Cinema around 3 or 4 a.m. Molinet also testified that Floyd told her that he knew 瘫the best way to kill a girl台 and put his hands around his own neck to indicate strangulation, and that Floyd, who appeared to be 瘫awful nervous,台 asked Molinet to be on the lookout for 瘫detective cars.台Id. We found the trial court was within its discretion in determining that Rule 804(b)(3) did not permit introduction of this testimony, because it was not sufficiently against Floyds interests: 瘫The statements attributed to Floyd did not constitute an admission of a crime. In and of themselves they did not even 跳tend to subject Floyd to criminal liability. At most, they cast suspicion on Floyd when paired with other information that may or may not have been known to Floyd.台 Id. We concluded by reiterating the deference we extend to trial courts in determining such debatable questions of admissibility: 瘫Trial judges 跳are close to the facts and far better able to evaluate the various circumstances than an appellate court, [and] therefore must be given wide discretion to examine a particular statement to determine whether all or part of it should beadmitted.台 Id. at 879 (quoting Williamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 621 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment)).","More recently, in Camm v. State, the defendant wished to present statements made by Charles Boney, whom the defendant asserted was the sole perpetrator of the triple murder in question, rather than a co-conspirator. 908 N.E.2d 215, 220 (Ind. 2009). Boneys statements sought to be introduced were: (1) in response to a private investigators hypothetical scenario, Boney stated that 瘫if physical evidence of Boneys presence at the scene of the killings was found, it would be 跳pretty obvious he was there and involved台; and (2) Boney told a friend that 瘫he had three bodies on his conscience, and that one more wouldnt matter.台 Id. at 232. We affirmed the trial courts exclusion of this testimony as not falling within the Rule 804(b)(3) hearsay exception, finding 瘫there is nothing that Boney is alleged to have said to the defendants investigator or to his friend that constituted an admission of a crime or tended to subject [Boney] to criminal liability.台 Id. (internal quotations omitted).","In both Jervis and Camm, the declarants statements sought to be admitted (one referencing dumping off a woman and the other having bodies on ones conscience) were vague and subject to interpretation. Here, we have no such ambiguity: Allen gave Beamon a precise account of his altercation with Beasley, and stated in no uncertain terms that he shot Beasley in the face. (Tr. at 350_54.) Even if Allen believed the shooting was justified as a matter of self-defense, it does not necessarily follow that Allen believed there was no possibility of future civil or criminal liability for the act. Beasley opposes this position by likening Allens statements to telling someone you 瘫drove home drunk last night,台 in support of his assertion that 瘫trivial 跳confessions of criminal conduct台 should not be rendered admissible hearsay under Rule 804(B)(3). Appellants Br. at 12. We cannot agree that the act of shooting a fellow human being in the face qualifies as 瘫trivial.台 Rather, we find the trial court could have reasonably determined that admitting to such a violent act would have 瘫so great a tendency . . . to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability台 that it was admissible hearsay under Rule 804(b)(3).","Beasley also contends that Allens statements to Beamon do not satisfy the exception because Allen expected Beamon to 瘫keep his confidences,台 and thus Allen did not believe the statements would expose him to criminal liability. Appellants Br. at 11. A slight change to the facts demonstrates why this argument is unavailing_had Beasley named Allen as his shooter when speaking with police, there would have been at least a minimal investigation of Allen, as demonstrated by the investigation of Beasleys gunshot wound after he went to the hospital. It is not a stretch to presume police would have questioned those whom Allen had contact with the day after the shooting, including Beamon. Thus Beamon would have been put in the position of either lying to the police or revealing what Allen told him, which could have been incriminating despite Allens claim of self-defense. In short, Allens statements to Beamon rendered Beamon a witness against Allen should Allen be prosecuted for Beasleys shooting, which is sufficient for those statements to qualify as being against Allens interests for purposes of a Rule 804(b)(3) hearsay exception.","Beasley also contends that Beamons testimony was inherently unreliable, because at best the trauma of the shooting could have impacted Beamons memory, and at worst, the personal and familial relationship between Allen and Beamon gave Beamon a motive to fabricate his testimony regarding Allens report of the shooting. Even if this were so, there is sufficient other corroborating evidence in the record to support the trial courts determination that Allens statements to Beamon_and Beamons related testimony_were reliable.","First and most significantly, Beasley actually went to the hospital with a gunshot wound to the face on the night of August 2. This begs the question: how could Allen have known about Beasleys injury if he was not involved? The record is devoid of any evidence that this shooting was made public, or of any witness to Beasleys shooting who might have informed Allen it had occurred prior to Allens conversation with Beasley the next day. Thus the trial court could have reasonably determined that Allen had firsthand knowledge of the event, lending credibility to Allens statements to Beamon. Beasley counters this point by noting he did not report Allen as the shooter, even though Beasley was well aware of Allens identity. There are, however, a number of potential reasons for this omission, the most obvious being that accepting Allens account as true, Beasley was shot with his own gun, and Beasleys very possession of that gun constituted a crime.4 Beasley therefore could not reveal Allen as his shooter without also revealing his own criminal activity. Moreover, if Beasley truly did plan to dispatch Allen the following day, there would be no reason to reveal Allens identity to the police_indeed, telling police that Allen had shot him might have resulted in Allen being incarcerated (at least temporarily), which would defeat such a plan. Finally, police found no evidence of the shooting at the location where Beasley claimed it had occurred, and thus the trial court could have reasonably determined that Beasley was being less than forthright in his version of events.","Second, police arrived at the hospital at approximately 8:30 p.m. the night Beasley was shot, and Allen thus could have been the shooter, sinceWilliams testified she left Allen sometime after 5:00 p.m. and picked him up again between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. At trial, Beasley alluded to contradictory deposition testimony, where Williams agreed that she had been with Allen from 5:00 p.m. onwards on August 2, to which Williams responded, 瘫I must have been confused . . . .台 Tr. at 684. Which account to credit was, however, within the province of the factfinder, and on appeal we construe the evidence in the manner most consistent with the trial courts judgment regarding the admissibility of evidence. See Pierce, 29 N.E.3d at 1264.","Third, Williams and Allen stayed at a hotel on the night of August 2 even though both had fixed housing nearby, and they checked in under Williamss name. These circumstances support the inference that Allen did not want to be easily located that night, either by police or by Beasley. Moreover, when coupled with the evidence of Allens home being ransacked, Allens decision to stay at a hotel supports the inference that Allen had cause to_and actually did_fear for his life, which is consistent with Allens account to Beamon of his violent altercation with Beasley and his fear of retaliation.","Although this corroborating evidence is not strictly required by our Rule 804(b)(3),5 it certainly supports the trial courts determination that Beamons hearsay testimony was reliable, which 瘫is, after all, the ultimate justification for admission of statements against interest.台 Jarvis, 679 N.E.2d at 879. We thus find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these hearsay statements under Rule 804(b)(3).","For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the admission of Gerald Beamons testimony regarding James Allens recount of his altercation with Leandrew Beasley, as such statements fell within the hearsay exception of Indiana Evidence Rule 804(b)(3).

Instead, Armour started receiving quarterly installment payments in the form of checks, which Armour accepted.","However, in December of 2012, AM General attempted to make the final installment payment with a subordinate promissory note (the Note). The language within the Note provided that acceptance would function to fully release AM General from its obligations under the LTIP provision of the Employment Agreement.

The term 瘫pay台 within the Employment Agreement obligated AM General to make the LTIP payment to Armour in cash or a cash equivalent.

We affirm the trial courts award of summary judgment in favor of Armour, including the award of pre-judgment interest.","On November 14, 2007, James Armour entered into an employment contract (Employment Agreement) with AM General, LLC. Under that contract, AM General 瘫shall pay to [Armour]台 an annual salary, an annual bonus, and a long-term incentive plan (LTIP). (A230-31, A241.) (emphasis added). Under the Employment Agreement, the LTIP payment was to be made 瘫at the time bonus payments under Section 2(a)(ii) are paid to other employees of [AM General] with respect to the Employers 2011 fiscal year.台 (A242, Tr. Ct. Order at 3.) On or about January 2, 2012, Armour retired as President, CEO, and Chairman of AM General. However, on or about January 20, 2012, when Armour and other AM General employees received their 2011 fiscal year bonuses, Armour did not receive his LTIP payment.","Rather, Armour began receiving his LTIP payment in installment checks. The first payment was made by check dated March 14, 2012. The second payment was made by check dated May 15, 2012. The third payment was made by check dated August 15, 2012. Armour accepted each of the three installment payments. Then, Armour received a promissory note from AM General dated December 14, 2012. The Note promised to pay Armour the remaining amount owed under the LTIP provision of his Employment Agreement. The Note provided, 瘫in accepting delivery of this Note, [the Holder] acknowledges that delivery of this Note satisfies all obligations of the Company under [the LTIP provision] of the Employment Agreement.台 (A161.) Full payment of the Note was not due until 2015, the Note was unsecured, transferable only upon certain conditions, and subordinate to other debts owed by AM General.","On December 20, 2012, Armours attorney responded to the receipt of the Note, and expressly refused to accept the Note as payment under the Employment Agreement. The letter demanded payment of all of the amounts owed to Armour under the Employment Agreement. In response, AM General filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that AM General had not breached the LTIP portion of its Employment Agreement with Armour. AM General expressed its belief that payment via the Note satisfied its obligations under the Employment Agreement and 瘫was in the best interests [sic] of AM General.台 (A14.)","Armour counter-claimed, asserting that AM General breached the Employment Agreement when it failed to pay Armour the full LTIP payment when it was due in early 2012. Armour also asserted that AM Generals attempt to satisfy its obligation to pay the remaining portion of the LTIP payment with a promissory note breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Subsequently, Armour sought summary judgment.","On June 27, 2013, a hearing was held on the summary judgment motion, and the trial court ultimately entered an order in favor of Armour. The trial court concluded that the plain meaning of 瘫pay台 or 瘫payment台 is 瘫to exchange cash or the cash equivalent for goods or services.台 (Tr. Ct. Order at 7.) The trial court concluded that the Note tendered to Armour cannot be construed as cash or its equivalent. As such, AM General breached the Employment Agreement by failing to timely pay the LTIP in cash and by Armour not accepting the Note as a substitute for payment. AM General was ordered to pay the remaining balance owed to Armour, in addition to pre-judgment interest calculated from January 20, 2012, through the date of judgment.","A split Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, finding a genuine issue of material fact in regards to how 瘫payment台 could be made under the LTIP provision of the Employment Agreement. AM General, LLC v. Armour, 27 N.E.2d 817, 821 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015). Chief Judge Vaidik dissented, agreeing with the trial court that the term 瘫pay台 within the Employment Agreement required payment to be in the form of cash or its equivalent, and a promissory note cannot satisfy AM Generals obligation to pay absent an express agreement. Id. at 821. Chief Judge Vaidik would have affirmed summary judgment in favor of Armour. Id. at 824.","Upon Armours petition, this Court granted transfer, thereby vacating the opinion of the Court of Appeals. Appellate Rule 58(A); AM General, LLC v. Armour, 34 N.E.3d 250 (Table). We now affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Armour and hold that the Note, as a matter of law, did not constitute payment under the Employment Agreement. As such, AM General breached its Employment Agreement with Armour. We also decline to find any genuine issue of material fact in relation to the calculation of pre-judgment interest and affirm the trial courts award of pre-judgment interest.","Orders for summary judgment are reviewed de novo, and require this Court to apply the same standard of review that is applied by the trial court. Indiana Restorative Dentistry, P.C. v. Laven Ins. Agency, Inc., 27 N.E.3d 260, 264 (Ind. 2015) (citing Hughley v. State, 15 N.E.3d 1000, 1003 (Ind. 2014)). The movant must demonstrate that 瘫the designated evidence raises no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.台 Id. Upon this showing, the nonmoving party then has the burden to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Id. All reasonable inferences will be construed in favor of the nonmoving party. Id.","In the present case, Armour and AM General dispute whether the term 瘫pay台 within the Employment Agreement is ambiguous, and whether an ambiguity in relation to the acceptable form of payment requires consideration of extrinsic evidence. Alternatively, AM General asserts that even if payment, as a matter of law, means cash or its equivalent, the designated evidence creates a genuine issue of fact that the Note tendered to Armour is a cash equivalent, and payment via the Note satisfied AM Generals obligation to pay the remaining LTIP amount under the Employment Agreement.","In the present case, the rules of contract construction govern the resolution of the disputed issue. The primary rule of construction first requires giving the words of the contract their plain and ordinary meaning. Ryan v. Ryan, 972 N.E.2d 359, 364 (Ind. 2012) (citation omitted). 瘫Clear and unambiguous terms in the contract are deemed conclusive, and when they are present we will not construe or look to extrinsic evidence, but will merely apply the contractual provisions.台 Id.","Under Indiana precedent, the term 瘫pay台 or 瘫payment台 has a plain legal meaning that can be applied in the present case. As such, we conclude that under the Employment Agreement, AM General was required to make the LTIP payments in cash or its equivalent. Because our analysis also demonstrates that the promissory Note tendered to, but rejected by, Armour was not the equivalent to a cash payment, AM General breached the Employment Agreement and Armour was entitled to summary judgment. Furthermore, the trial court did not err by ordering pre-judgment interest to be calculated from the date payment was due under the Employment Agreement.","Armour argues that the form of payment due under the Employment Agreement presents a question of law, not fact. Moreover, Armour contends that no genuine issue of material fact was created based upon an affidavit submitted by the Vice President of Human Resources at AM General, which provided that, 瘫unlike bonus payments, which the contract expressly stated must be paid in cash, the contract did not address the issue of how LTIP payments were to be made.台 (Pet Tr. at 6-7; App. at 224.) AM General contends, among other things, that because the form of payment was not specified in the Employment Agreement, the term 瘫pay台 was ambiguous and subject to interpretation based upon extrinsic evidence, such as the Redemption Agreement. The Redemption Agreement was executed on the same day as the Employment Agreement and did allow for specified payments to be made with a subordinate note under some circumstances.","First and foremost, we agree with Armour that the meaning of 瘫pay台 within the Employment Agreement presents a question of law. If ambiguity in a contract 瘫arises because of the language used in the contract and not because of extrinsic facts then its construction is purely a question of law to be determined by the trial court.台 First Federal Sav. Bank of Indiana v. Key Markets, Inc., 559 N.E.2d 600, 604 (Ind. 1990) (internal citation omitted); See also Holiday Hospitality Franchising, Inc. v. AMCO Insurance Co., 983 N.E.2d 574, 577 (Ind. 2013) (explaining that contract construction 瘫is particularly well-suited for de novo appellate review, because it generally presents questions purely of law台) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). In the present case, only the meaning of the word 瘫pay台 is disputed, which 瘫has a well-understood meaning, and in legal contemplation payment is the discharge in money or its equivalent of an obligation or debt owing by one person to another.台 Egbert v. Egbert, 235 Ind. 405, 418, 132 N.E.2d 910, 917 (Ind. 1956) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Additionally, 瘫the law declares that payment shall be made in money, unless there is an enforceable contract providing for payment in something of value other than money.台 Vansickle v. Ferguson, 122 Ind. 450, 23 N.E. 858 (1890). The affidavit submitted by AM General only demonstrates that the form of payment was not specified in the Employment Agreement. However, as stated above, where the form of payment is not specified, Indiana law mandates that either cash or its equivalent is required.","The parties do not dispute that AM General attempted to 瘫pay台 Armour with a promissory note, nor do they dispute that various conditions were placed upon the receipt of payment under the terms of the Note. Thus, the primary issue is whether the Note was a cash equivalent, which would be necessary to satisfy AM Generals contractual obligation to pay Armour the LTIP amounts.","By looking to the Note itself, it is apparent that the Note is not the equivalent to cash. Rather, various limitations are placed upon receiving payment of the principal amount, which makes the Note starkly distinguishable from a cash payment. First, the principal of the Note was not due until three years after the LTIP payments were due under the Employment Agreement. Second, the Note was unsecured and subordinate to large bank debts that AM General owed. Finally, the Note could only be transferred under specific conditions. Thus, these conditions create the possibility that Armour may never receive actual payment, and even if payment were obtained, it would be delayed years beyond when it was due under the Employment Agreement. Moreover, the very definition of a promissory note demonstrates that the Note itself is not payment, but is merely a promise to pay some amount in the future. See Blacks Law Dictionary 9th Ed., p.1162 (defining 瘫promissory note台 as 瘫[a]n unconditional written promise . . . to pay absolutely and in any event a certain sum of money either to, or to the order of, the bearer or a designated person台) (emphasis added). Thus, AM Generals tender of the Note, while it was a promise to pay, was not 瘫payment台 as demanded by the Employment Agreement.","AM General accurately recites that summary judgment may 瘫be precluded by as little as a non-movants mere designation of a self-serving affidavit.台 Hughley v. State, 15 N.E.3d 1000, 1003 (Ind. 2014) (internal quotation and citation omitted). However, upon review of Hughley, it is clear that a self-serving affidavit may only preclude summary judgment when it establishes that material facts are in dispute, and not when an affidavit merely disputes a legal issue. Here, AM General designated an affidavit which provided that the form of payment under the Employment Agreement was not specified. Yet, the affidavit in Hughley is distinguishable from that submitted by AM General because the affidavit in Hughley went to a disputed issue of fact.","In Hughley, the parties disputed what property may be subject to forfeiture, which required the parties to present evidence of how the property was used. Id. at 1004. Because the parties offered affidavits which supported conflicting inferences on how the property was used, the 瘫trier of fact [was] required to resolve the parties differing accounts of the truth.台 Id. (internal citations omitted). The use of property was a disputed issue of fact. Nothing within the language of Hughley indicates a change to the established understanding that when addressing a motion for summary judgment, 瘫[t]he averment of facts which create only an issue of law, rather than an issue of fact, will not defeat the motion.台 Babchuck v. Heinold Elevator, Co., 246 N.E.2d 211, 216 (Ind. Ct. App. 1969) (emphasis added). The language within Hughley even maintains the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact by reiterating that 瘫[s]ummary judgment 跳is a desirable tool to allow the trial court to dispose of cases where only legal issues exist.台 Hughley, 15 N.E.3d at 1003 (quoting Clipp v. Weaver, 451 N.E.2d 1092, 1093 (Ind. 1983)) (emphasis added).","In the present case, the affidavit only solidifies what is apparent from the face of the Employment Agreement and what the parties already agree; the Employment Agreement does not specify a particular form in which the LTIP payments are to be made. To the extent that AM General contends that the affidavit creates a genuine issue as to the permissible form of payment of the LTIP, the affidavit would only go to a legal issue, which can properly be decided on summary judgment. As explained above, the word pay is unambiguous and requires payment to be made in cash or its equivalent. All of the facts necessary to determine whether the Note is the equivalent to a cash payment is represented on the face of the Note. The parties do not dispute that the Note was not due until three years after it was delivered, was unsecured and subordinate to other AM General debts, and had limitations placed upon transfer.2 As such, granting summary judgment in this context does not run contrary to our holding in Hughley because the affidavit submitted by AM General did not create a genuine issue of material fact, as the affidavits in Hughley did.","瘫When a court finds a contract to be clear in its terms and the intentions of the parties apparent, the court will require the parties to perform consistently with the bargain they made.台 Key Markets, Inc., 559 N.E.2d at 604. Because the promissory Note did not constitute 瘫payment台 under Armours Employment Agreement, AM General breached its contract with Armour. Accordingly, we affirm the trial courts grant of summary judgment in favor of Armour.","AM General also contends that there was a genuine issue of material fact about the starting date for calculating the pre-judgment interest. The trial court ordered pre-judgment interest based upon a January 20, 2012 start date, which was the date the LTIP payment was due under the Employment Agreement. Moreover, the trial court relied upon the interest calculations as submitted by AM Generals Vice President of Human Resources. The parties do not dispute that under the Employment Agreement, the LTIP payment was due on or about January 20, 2012. Rather, AM General argues that Armour made an oral agreement in December 2011 to accept LTIP payments in quarterly installments throughout 2012 and that his acceptance of three installment checks after the January contract deadline served to ratify the parties modified agreement that the LTIP payments were due 瘫over the course of 2012.台 (Resp. Pet. Tr. at 3-5.) Due to this, AM General argues that pre-judgment interest should be calculated from December 31, 2012, not January 20, 2012.","Again, we disagree with AM Generals contention that there is a genuine issue of material fact in relation to the start date for calculating pre-judgment interest. First, the Employment Agreement specifically provided that it could 瘫not be modified except by a writing signed by the parties hereto.台 (A239.) AM General does not contend that there was ever a writing upon which Armour agreed to accept LTIP payments as installments throughout 2012. Rather, AM General asserts that a phone call was made to Armour in December 2011 瘫to explain to Mr. Armour the current circumstances at AM General and why it was in AM Generals best interest to make the 2012 LTIP payments in quarterly installments.台 (A511.) Because Armour 瘫did not reject the quarterly installment program,台 AM General believed that Armour had agreed to the program. (A512.) Armor contends that during that phone conversation he told AM General that it 瘫did not have the right to defer making the LTIP payment . . . .台 (A511.) Thus, while there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether an oral agreement was ever made, summary judgment would still be appropriate if the alleged oral modification is otherwise invalid.","Even if we presume that the oral agreement occurred as AM General contends and that the oral modification could supersede the contractual provision requiring all modifications to be in writing,3 瘫the modification of a contract, because it is also a contract, requires all of the requisite elements of a contract.台 City of Indianapolis v. Twin Lakes Enterprises, Inc., 568 N.E.2d 1073, 1085 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991) (citation omitted). Thus, a modification must have adequate consideration. Hinkel v. Sataria Distribution & Packaging, Inc., 920 N.E.2d 766, 770 (Ind. Ct. App. 2010) (internal citation omitted). 瘫Consideration consist of either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee.台 Id. 瘫In other words, consideration requires a bargained-for exchange.台 Id. Here, even if the oral agreement occurred as AM General contends, Armour received nothing in exchange for AM General making the LTIP payments in four installments, rather than as a lump sum payment on January 20, 2012. Under the alleged modification, AM General only agreed to do what it already had an obligation to do under the existing Employment Agreement; pay the full amount owed under the LTIP provision.4 See Seastrom, Inc. v. Amick Const. Co., Inc., 315 N.E.2d 431, 433 (Ind. Ct. App. 1974) (finding no 瘫new and distinct consideration台 to support a contract modification where the promisor was 瘫doing no more than he was obligated to do under台 the existing contract). Accordingly, even if the oral agreement had occurred, it fails as a valid contract modification for lack of consideration.","AM General also argues that Armour waived the argument that payment was due at the time specified in the Employment Agreement by accepting three installment payments. However, the express terms within the contract undercut this argument. The Employment Agreement provides that 瘫[t]he failure of either party to insist upon the strict performance of any of the terms, conditions, and provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of future compliance therewith, and said terms, conditions, and provision shall remain in full force and effect.台 (A238.) Where an employment contract contains such a clause, Indiana courts have upheld a finding that no waiver of contractual obligations have occurred. See Sallee v. Mason, 714 N.E.2d 757, 762 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) (determining that even though no evidence supported a finding that annual salary reviews or adjustments required by the contract had ever occurred in the past, the plaintiff had not relinquished her right to demand an annual review because the employment contract provided that 瘫the failure to enforce any provision or obligation under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver therefore or serve as a bar to the subsequent enforcement of such provision or obligation台). Armour did not relinquish his right to demand the LTIP payments at the time they were due under the Employment Agreement because he subsequently accepted three installment payments.","Because any modification to the Employment Agreement regarding when the LTIP payments were due failed for lack of consideration, there is no genuine issue of fact regarding the trial courts determination that pre-judgment interest should be calculated from January 20, 2012. Moreover, since the trial court relied upon the affidavit and exhibits submitted by AM General in determining the amount of pre-judgment interests that should be awarded based upon the January 20, 2012 start date, we affirm the trial courts award of pre-judgment interest.","AM General failed to satisfy its obligation under the Employment Agreement LTIP provision when it offered Armour a subordinate promissory note as payment. As a matter of law, payment under the contract required the LTIP to be paid in cash or a cash equivalent. The various conditions placed upon the Note demonstrates that the Note was not a cash equivalent. We affirm the trial courts grant of summary judgment in favor of Armour, awarding him the remaining portion of his LTIP payments. We also affirm the trial courts order awarding Armour pre-judgment interest calculated from January 20, 2012, the time at which the LTIP payment was due under the Employment Agreement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
