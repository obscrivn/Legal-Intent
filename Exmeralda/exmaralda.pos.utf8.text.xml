<body>Indiana courts strictly construe contracts to indemnify a party against its own negligence'recognizing that a party would not lightly accept liability for someone else's negligence . Thus , indemnity clauses must state the parties' intent to indemnify in clear and unequivocal language . Otherwise , we will not find a knowing and willing agreement to indemnify . And the need for explicit language is especially important when an agreement involves retroactive indemnity'since even in insurance contracts , where indemnity is the central purpose , we presume that insurers would not accept liability for a known , existing loss . Here , Mid-America Sound argues that the Indiana State Fair Commission accepted liability for an existing , catastrophic loss'not through explicit contract language calling for retroactive indemnification , but through a years-long course of conduct in paying invoices that had standard indemnity language on the back . But as a matter of law , a form of liability so disfavored can not be implied from a course of dealing when it is not expressed by clear and unequivocal contract language . We therefore grant transfer and affirm the trial court's grant of sum-mary judgment for the Commission . Indiana has held its famed State Fair nearly every year since 1852 . An evolving Hoosier tradition , the Fair has become more than just an agricultural exposition . It is now a major commercial event for the general public , attracting rural and urban Hoosiers alike'featuring concerts , tractor pulls , demolition derbies , monster truck shows , and a seemingly boundless supply of food . The Indiana State Fair Commission manages the Fair , and by extension , the concerts and other major events that take place at the Fair . Since the 1990s , the Commission uti-lized Mid-America Sound to provide equipment and services for those concerts and events . That equipment often included a temporary roof for the grandstand stage , speakers , and lights . During the last ten years of their relationship , the Commission and Mid-America followed a standard routine . Before each Fair , they agreed on the equipment to be delivered and the corre-sponding prices . Then after the Fair , Mid-America would collect the equipment and submit a blank claim voucher form,1 with invoices for the rentals attached . The Commission would then verify whether all the invoiced items had actually been provided and , if so , sign the claim voucher to authorize payment . All told , the parties followed this course of dealing more than a hundred times over those ten years . Tragedy struck on the night of August 13 , 2011 . Just prior to the Sugarland concert at the grandstand stage , strong winds approached the Fairgrounds . While Mid-America's on-site technicians worked to remove equipment hanging from Mid-America's roof , the roof collapsed , killing seven people and injuring many more . Shortly thereafter , the victims and families filed law-suits naming several defendants , including Mid-America and the Commission . Then , on December 7 , 2011 , while those lawsuits were still pending , Mid-America sent the Commission a two-sided invoice for the lease of the collapsed roof and services provided , along with the single-sided claim voucher form . Above the Commission's signature , the voucher contained certifications 'that the attached invoice is true and correct' and 'in accordance with contract.' The Commission signed the voucher and authorized payment , which it remitted via check . In March 2012 , Mid-America filed a third-party lawsuit against the Commission , claiming that two sentences located on the back of the December 2011 invoice entitled it to indemnification for its own negligence in relation to the August 2011 roof collapse . One of the two sentences , located under a heading entitled 'Rentals , ' read as follows : [ The Commission ] assumes risks inherent in the operation and use of the equipment and agrees to assume the entire responsibility for the defense of , and to pay , indemnify and hold [ Mid-America ] harmless from and hereby releases [ Mid-America ] from any and all claims for damage to property or bodily injury resulting from the use , operation or possession of the equipment , whether or not it be claimed or held that such damage or injury resulted in whole or in part from [ Mid-America's ] negligence , from the condition of the equipment or from any cause , [ the Commission ] agrees that no warranties , expressed or implied have been made in connection with this rental . The other sentence , located under the 'Shows' heading , set forth essentially the same language . Mid-America and the Commission proceeded to file cross-motions for summary judgment , taking opposite positions about whether the December 2011 invoice's indemnity language applied retroactively to the August 2011 roof collapse . The trial court granted the Commission's motion , and Mid-America appealed . A divided Court of Appeals reversed and remanded , finding that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether the Commission knowingly and willingly agreed to indemnify Mid-America for the roof collapse . In re Ind . State Fair Litigation , 28 N.E.3d 333 , 343 . As we have recently reiterated , summary judgment imposes a heavy factual burden on the moving party'and a correspondingly light burden for the non-movant's response'because 'Indiana consciously errs on the side of letting marginal cases proceed to trial on the merits , rather than risk short-circuiting meritorious claims.' Hughley v. State , 15 N.E.3d 1000 , 1004 . By definition , cases that hinge upon disputed facts are inappropriate for summary judgment , because 'weighing [ evidence ] 'no matter how decisively the scales may seem to tip' [ is ] a matter for trial , not summary judgment.' Id . at 1005_06 . By contrast , matters of contract interpretation are 'particularly well-suited for de novo appellate review , ' because they 'generally present [ ] questions purely of law.' Holiday Hospitality Franchising , Inc. v. AMCO Ins . Co. , 983 N.E.2d 574 , 577 . A contract may be construed on summary judgment if it 'is not ambiguous or uncertain , ' or if 'the contract ambiguity , if one exists , can be resolved without the aid of a factual determination.' Warrick County ex rel . Conner v. Hill , 973 N.E.2d 1138 , 1144 , trans . denied . The meaning of a contract is a question for the factfinder , precluding summary judgment , only where interpreting an ambiguity requires extrinsic evidence . Tate v. Secura Ins. , 587 N.E.2d 665 , 668 . Moreover , our standard of review remains unchanged when , as here , the parties file cross-motions for summary judgment'we simply 'consider each motion separately to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' SCI Propane , LLC v. Frederick , 39 N.E.3d 675 , 677 ) . Our analysis begins with a dim view of indemnity clauses like the one at issue here . At one time , Indiana flatly prohibited at least some contracts for indemnity against a party's own negligence . See , e.g. , Freigy v. Gargaro Co. , 223 Ind . 342 , 352 , 60 N.E.2d 288 , 292 ; Penn . R. Co. v. Kent , 136 Ind . App . 551 , 560 , 198 N.E.2d 615 , 619 ) . We later retreated from that prohibition and now generally allow parties , as a matter of freedom of contract , 'to allocate risk by contract''including by agreeing to 'indemnification for one's own negligence.' Fresh Cut , Inc. v. Fazli , 650 N.E.2d 1126 , 1130 ) . Even so , indemnity provisions are strictly con-strued'we treat them as 'disfavor [ ed ] . . . because we are mindful that to obligate one party to pay for the negligence of another is a harsh burden that no party would lightly accept.' Henthorne v. Legacy Healthcare , Inc. , 764 N.E.2d 751 , 757 . Accordingly , indemnity is permissible only if the contract language shows in 'clear and unequivocal terms' that the obligated party 'knowingly and willingly agrees to such indemnification.' Id . Moreover , our courts have generally taken for granted that the parties would be bargaining about prospective liability , by referring to 'future acts of negligence' or making the agreement 'in advance.' E.g. , Indianapolis Power and Light Co. , 578 N.E.2d at 670 ; Powell v. Am . Health Fitness Ctr . of Fort Wayne , Inc. , 694 N.E.2d 757 , 760 ) ) . That assumption'that parties would bargain over only prospective liability'is rooted in the very nature of allocating risk . One context in which Indiana has recognized that assumption is the 'known loss' doctrine in insurance law'which embodies the commonsense principle that a party can not 'insure' against a loss that has already happened , because there is no 'risk' left to be allocated : The 'known loss' doctrine is a common law concept deriving from the fundamental requirement in insurance law that the loss be fortuitous . Simply put , the known loss doctrine states that one may not obtain insurance for a loss that has already taken place . Describing the known loss doctrine , commentators have noted that losses which exist at the time of the insuring agreement , or which are so probable or imminent that there is insufficient 'risk' being transferred between the insured and insurer , are not proper subjects of insurance . . . . . . . [ W ] e hold that if an insured has actual knowledge that a loss has occurred , is occurring , or is substantially certain to occur on or before the effective date of the policy , the known loss doctrine will bar coverage . This is not to say , however , that parties may not explicitly agree to cover existing losses . Indeed , the known loss doctrine is inapplicable if the insurer also knew of the circumstances on which it bases the defense . Gen . Housewares Corp. v. Nat'l Sur . Corp. , 741 N.E.2d 408 , 413_14 ) . The basic rationale of the known-loss rule applies with equal force in the context of this non-insurance indemnity provision . If a potential future liability 'is a harsh burden that a party would not lightly accept , ' GKN Co. v. Starnes Trucking , Inc. , 798 N.E.2d 548 , 552 , then actual retroactive liability for a known loss is harsher still'indeed , it would ordinarily be a fool's bargain . 'This is not to say , however , that parties may not explicitly agree to cover existing losses , ' Gen . Housewares , 741 N.E.2d at 414 'that is , 'in clear and unequivocal terms , ' to be strictly construed . GKN Co. , 798 N.E.2d at 552 . But Indiana law makes clear that we will not infer a party's agreement to such an onerous liability unless that intent is expressed unmistakably . Though Indiana contract law suggests a particularly strong disfavor for retroactive indemnity provisions as discussed above , we have never squarely addressed the retroactivity question . Nine other jurisdictions , however , have similarly concluded that such an extraordinary obligation as retro-active indemnity must be expressed unmistakably . Georgia states the rule particularly emphatically , requiring agreements for retroactive indemnity to be stated 'expressly , plainly , clearly , and unequi-vocally' to be valid . Service Merch . Co. v. Hunter Fan Co. , 617 S.E.2d 235 , 240 . Delaware , Hawaii , Iowa , Michigan , Nebraska , and New York declare similar standards , requiring such provisions to be completely unambiguous . Fina , Inc. v. ARCO , 200 F.3d 266 , 273 ; Chicago and N.W . Transp . Co. v. Emmet Fertilizer and Grain Co. , 852 F.2d 358 , 360 ; Servco Pac . Inc. v. Dods , 193 F. Supp . 2d 1183 , 1193 ; DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Wesco Distribution , Inc. , 760 N.W.2d 828 , 833 ) ; Quality King Distribs. , Inc. v. E and M ESR , Inc. , 827 N.Y.S.2d 700 , 703 ) ; Evans v. Howard R. Green Co. , 231 N.W.2d 907 , 916_17 , p. 581 ) ) . And Maryland and Pennsylvania simply take for granted'seemingly as too obvious for analysis'that indemnity clauses can not apply to liabilities that predate the contract . See Bunker Ramo-Eltra Corp. v. Fairchild Indus. , 639 F. Supp . 409 , 419 ; Werner v. Big Sky Shop , 630 F. Supp . 444 , 451 . Each of these decisions is consistent with Indiana's requirement of 'clear and unequivocal' language'construing such provisions strictly , as New York has explained , 'to avoid reading into them duties which the parties did not intend to be assumed.' Quality King , 827 N.Y.S.2d at 702 . But two cases , one from Michigan and one from Iowa , are particularly analogous , because they involve indemnity language contained in routine , standard-form documents exchanged after an accident . In DaimlerChrysler , a Wesco employee was hurt while preparing a quote for electrical repair work at a DaimlerChrysler plant . 760 N.W.2d at 830 . After the accident , DC issued Wesco a purchase order for the quoted work , with language requiring Wesco to indemnify DC for losses 'arising out of or related to the performance of any work in connection with this contract.' Id . at 830_31 . The court held that the language of the post-accident purchase order did not show an intent to indemnify for pre-contract losses : It is one thing to decide whether an injury occurring during the term of the contract falls within the contract's coverage language , but it is quite another to decide whether a party has agreed to indemnify another for an injury that occurred before the indemnity provision was agreed upon . Hence , . . . we must look to whether the parties provided language that shows an intent to require indemnification for precontract activity . Id . at 834 . Finding no such terms in the purchase order , the court held Wesco had no obligation to indemnify DC for losses in connection with the pre-contract accident . Id . Similarly , in Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Estate of Lartius , an employer rented a crane for a day , and his employee was injured while using it . No . 06-1725 , 2007 WL 3087505 , at *1 .3 Twelve days later , the employer rented another crane from the same company , and when he returned it , he paid both days' rental fees and initialed a 'work order' for both days that contained small-print indemnity language on the front . Id . The employer did not read the work order before initialing it , even though all parties were aware of the employee's injury . Id . Even though the employer's failure to read the work order did not make its terms unenforceable , the terms themselves could not be construed to impose retroactive liability because the contract language did not 'specifically provide [ ] for . . . indemnification of Crane Rental's prior losses or liabilities' and therefore was 'not sufficient to meet the plain and manifest intent requirement of Evans.' Id . at *3_*4 . Bearing in mind the skepticism with which Indiana and other states view alleged agreements to indemnify retroactively for known losses , we now turn to Mid-America's contention that it reached such an agreement with the Commission through a long-running course of dealing . Though none of the indemnity language in this invoice expressly extends to losses prior to the invoice date , Mid-America argues that its course of dealing with the Commission established such an agreement'or at least raises a question of fact of whether such an agreement existed . Again , the parties stopped exchanging contracts before the Fair in 2002 and began using claim vouchers and invoices after the Fair'and then , starting in 2003 , the invoices included the same indemnity lan-guage at issue here . And the claim vouchers , which the Commission signed and submitted for payment , certified that the attached in-voices'including the indemnity language they contained'were 'in accordance with [ the ] contract.' In essence , Mid-America argues that under this course of dealing , the invoices' indemnity language is not being applied retroactively . Instead , it asserts that the invoices memorialized a standing recognition from each previous year's dealings that the following year's rental would be subject to the same indemnification requirements . But the Eighth Circuit , applying Nebraska law , rejected a similar argument in Emmet Fertilizer , 852 F.2d at 359_60 . There , Emmet had installed a fertilizer unloader at a railroad's facility in 1977 . Id . at 359 . Then in 1978 , an Emmet employee was badly hurt while operating the unloader and later settled a negligence claim against the railroad for his injuries . Id . The railroad then sought indemnification from Emmet based on indemnity language in a 1981 license agreement for the unloader . Id . The Emmet Court first observed that the license did not unambiguously provide for retroactive effect , and that ' [ i ] f the parties had intended Emmet's indemnity obligation to extend to past accidents , they could easily have designed the language . . . to say exactly that.' Id . at 360 . The Court then rejected an argument much like the course-of-dealing claim Mid-America makes here'that Emmet knew its installation would be subject to the indemnity provisions of the railroad's 'standard license agreement , ' which Emmet had signed twice before as part of similar installations : [ The railroad ] presents an alternate theory of recovery'that Emmet had orally agreed as early as 1976 to maintain its fertilizer unloader subject to [ the railroad's ] 'standard license agreement.' Emmet had previously signed two license agreements covering facilities similar to the fertilizer unloader , each of which contained an indemnity provision . [ The railroad ] reasons that the indemnity clauses of these earlier licenses were incorporated by reference into an implied oral agreement governing the fertilizer unloader from 1976 onward . Id . But the Court refused to rely on that course of dealing 'to infer the existence of a type of obliga-tion that is not favored in Nebraska courts' in the absence of 'clear and unequivocal language''specifically noting that 'Nebraska law requires specific proof of the indemnitor's intent to be bound by such an extraordinary obligation.' Id . . We reach the same conclusion here , for the same reasons . As we have explained , Indiana law likewise requires a 'clear and unequivocal' expression of a 'knowing [ ] and willing [ ] ' agreement to indemnify a party for its own negligence , GKN Co. , 798 N.E.2d at 552'and moreover , to say so 'explicitly' if they further intend that liability 'to cover existing losses , ' Gen . Housewares , 741 N.E.2d at 414 . Even accepting all of Mid-America's evidence as true for purposes of summary judgment , see Hughley , 15 N.E.3d at 1003 , the parties' course of dealing can not substitute for a 'clear and unequivocal' indication in the contract itself that the Commission 'knowingly and willingly' agreed to indemnify Mid-America for its own negligence in connection with a cata-strophic loss that had already happened . See GKN Co. , 798 N.E.2d at 552 . Mid-America's reliance on Southern Railway Company v. Arlen Realty and Development Corp. , a Virginia case taking the opposite view , is misplaced . 257 S.E.2d 841 . There , Arlen leased trailers from the railroad for several years , usually executing the lease agreements after picking up the trailers . Id . at 842 . An Arlen employee sued the railroad after being injured while picking up a trailer . Id . at 842_43 . The railroad pursued Arlen based on indemnity language in the lease agreements , but Arlen argued the language was not binding because the lease was not signed until after the employee's accident . Id . at 843 , 845 . The court disagreed , 'finding that the parties , by their course of dealings , had assented to and adopted the terms of the printed form as their agreement . . . in hundreds of transactions between the parties over a period of several years preceding' the employee's injury . Id . at 845 . But Virginia is an outlier in that it treats indemnity agreements just like any other contract . See Carpenter Insulation and Coatings Co. v. Statewide Sheet Metal and Roofing Corp. , 937 F.2d 602 , *3 . And , in more than 35 years , Arlen has been cited on this course-of-dealing issue only once'by the Court of Appeals' now-vacated decision in this case . Mid-America points to no other similar holding , and we find none . We therefore decline to follow Arlen , which represents a minority view based on different contract-law principles . In summary , then , the principle we deduce from Indiana contract law is this : Indemnification for another party's negligence'especially retroactively'is an 'extraordinary obligation' that is generally 'not favored.' Emmet Fertilizer , 852 F.2d at 360 . Accordingly , as a matter of law , we will not infer that obligation from a course of dealing when , as here , the parties' contract does not expressly call for it in 'clear and unequivocal terms.' GKN Co. , 798 N.E.2d at 552 . The trial court therefore correctly granted summary judgment for the Commission and against Mid-America . In view of that conclusion , we express no opinion on whether the Commission is a govern-mental entity with immunity under the Indiana Tort Claims Act , Ind . Code ch . 34-13-3 ; whether indemnity for another party's negligence is a tort- or contract-based liability for ITCA purposes ; or whether the invoices' indemnity language is void against public policy . But those arguments do illustrate why Mid-America's failure to make a 'clear and unequivocal' demand for retroactive indemnification is particularly significant in these circumstances . Regardless of their merits , those claims are not implausible'and therefore it seems that a party seeking to impose such a disfavored liability under these circumstances would have particular incentive to draft its contract in the clearest and most unequivocal terms possible . Mid-America's failure to do so here further underscores why we should not infer an extraordinary liability when a contract fails to provide for it expressly . The terms of Mid-America's invoices to the Commission did not clearly and unequivocally provide for retroactive application , and as a matter of law , we will not infer such an onerous provision from the parties' course of dealing . We therefore affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the Commission . Following a jury trial , the defendant was convicted of two counts of Class B felony Burglary for breaking and entering into a farmhouse . Because the jury instruction 's expansion of the statutory definition of a `` dwelling '' for purposes of Class B felony Burglary included misleading language and invaded the province of the jury , we direct the trial court to change the Class B felony Burglary convictions to Class C felony Burglary convictions and to resentence the defendant accordingly . The defendant , Shane Keller , was convicted of eight felonies_three counts of Burglary , three counts of Theft , and two counts of Receiving Stolen Property_for taking possessions from a farm in Washington County , Indiana , between May and September of 2013 . Two of the burglary convictions resulted from breaking and entering into an old farmhouse on the property . Jeremy Hardwick , who planned to move his family into the farmhouse `` in a short period , '' was remodeling the farmhouse because it had been in `` pretty rough '' shape after sitting empty for ten to twelve years . Tr . at 501 , 503 . He was at the farm every day after work , feeding the animals and working on the house . The school bus dropped his daughter off at the farm in the afternoon , and he had his mail delivered there as well . The Hardwick family stored all of their belongings_except beds and the clothes they wore on a daily basis_at the farmhouse , mostly packed in boxes or piled around the house . The farmhouse had one completed bathroom , new drywall and plumbing , and a new electrical system , but several parts of the house still needed finished , including flooring , kitchen cabinets , trim , and appliance installation . The defendant 's two Class B felony Burglary convictions for breaking into the farmhouse required the jury to find that the `` building or structure '' broken into was a `` dwelling . `` 1 At trial , the parties argued extensively about how the jury instructions should define a dwelling . The defendant proposed an instruction matching the statutory definition of `` a building , structure , or other enclosed space , permanent or temporary , movable or fixed , that is a person 's home or place of lodging . '' Appellant 's App'x at 568 ; Ind . Code _ 35-31.5-2-107 . The State 's proposed instruction also included that statutory definition , but added a sentence based on a separate decision of the Court of Appeals discussing sufficiency of the evidence : `` Any such place where a person keeps personal items with the intent to reside at some future time is considered a dwelling . '' Appellant 's App'x at 544 ; accord White v. State 846 N.E.2d 1026 , 1031 . The final instruction given the jury read : For the purposes of the burglary [ statute ] , a dwelling is defined as a building , structure , or other enclosed space , permanent or temporary , movable or fixed , that is a person 's home or place of lodging . Any such place where a person keeps personal items with the intent to reside in the near future is considered a dwelling . Appellant 's App'x at 596 . Informed by this instruction , the jury found the defendant guilty of both counts of Class B felony Burglary . The defendant appealed , alleging error in the dwelling instruction , multiple evidentiary errors , double jeopardy violations , and sentence inappropriateness . The Court of Appeals affirmed in part , reversed in part , and remanded for resentencing . Keller v. State , 25 N.E.3d 807 . The State petitioned for transfer , challenging the sufficiency analysis employed by the Court of Appeals_an issue not presented by the defendant . We granted transfer , thus assuming jurisdiction over the appeal and all issues . Ind . App . R. 58 . We address only the instructional error issue and otherwise summarily affirm the Court of Appeals . Id . In his challenge to the final instruction defining a dwelling , the defendant argues that `` [ t ] he trial court erred by instructing the jury beyond the statutory definition of dwelling . . . . [ by adding language that ] unfairly emphasized particular facts , invaded the province of the jury and misled the jury . '' Appellant 's Br . at 10 . `` We review a trial court 's instructions to the jury for an abuse of discretion . '' Isom v. State , 31 N.E.3d 469 , 484 . The trial court abuses its discretion `` when the instruction is erroneous and the instructions taken as a whole misstate the law or otherwise mislead the jury . `` 2 Id . at 484-85 . The challenged final instruction amplified the statutory definition of a dwelling by telling the jury that the definition would be satisfied by a specific set of facts not identified by the statute . Article 1 , Section 19 of the Indiana Constitution protects the province of the jury in criminal trials : `` In all criminal cases whatever , the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts . '' An instruction that invades this province by inappropriately emphasizing certain facts is erroneous and misleads the jury . See Ludy v. State , 784 N.E.2d 459 , 461 . Here , the last sentence of the dwelling instruction told the jury that `` [ a ] ny such place where a person keeps personal items with the intent to reside in the near future is considered a dwelling . '' Appellant 's App'x at 596 . By emphasizing a set of facts that would satisfy the statutory definition of a dwelling , this language restricted the jury 's discretion in applying the statutory definition in light of all the admitted evidence about the farmhouse . This also misled the jury by encouraging it to single out certain facts while ignoring others that it may and should consider . See Fry v. State , 447 N.E.2d 569 , 573 . Under our Constitution , `` it [ is ] the province of the jury to determine the weight to be given . . . each item placed in evidence . '' Woodson v. State , 542 N.E.2d 1331 , 1334 . Because the last sentence of the instruction `` invite [ d the jury ] to violate its obligation to consider all the evidence , '' the instruction invaded the province of the jury in violation of the Indiana Constitution . Ludy , 784 N.E.2d at 462 . The State argues that `` [ t ] he trial court did not abuse its discretion because the instruction is rooted in binding precedent . '' Appellee 's Br . at 15.3 But as explained above , ingraining a single example of a dwelling into an instruction emphasizes certain facts , which invades the province of the jury . For this reason , we have long held that the `` mere fact that certain language or expression [ is ] used in the opinions of this Court to reach its final conclusion does not make it proper language for instructions to a jury . '' Ludy , 784 N.E.2d at 462 .4 Appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence , as in White , will `` rarely , if ever , '' be an appropriate basis for a jury instruction , because the determination is fundamentally different . Garfield v. State , 74 Ind . 60 , 64 .5 `` [ A ] trial court jury is not reviewing whether a conviction is supported . It is determining in the first instance whether the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant committed a charged crime . '' Ludy , 784 N.E.2d at 461 . While the instruction accurately reflected the holding in White , that case addressed an appellate legal issue_the sufficiency the evidence_and not the facts of this case , which are reserved for the jury . White , 846 N.E.2d at 1030-31.6 White does not justify the instruction . The addition of the last sentence to the challenged final instruction was misleading and invaded the province of the jury and was therefore erroneous . We thus reverse the defendant's Class B felony Burglary convictions . Under the Burglary statute at the time of the offenses , Burglary was a Class C felony , but was enhanced to a Class B felony if the building or structure broken into was a dwelling . Because the erroneous language only related to the dwelling element , we instruct the trial court to modify the two Class B felony Burglary convictions from Class B felonies to Class C felonies and to resentence the defendant accordingly . See Bradley v. State , 867 N.E.2d 1282 , 1286 . As to the other appellate issues we summarily affirm the Court of Appeals.7 Ind . App . R. 58 . As established , the trial court 's dwelling instruction erroneously amplified the statutory definition of a dwelling for Burglary as a Class B felony by declaring that a specific set of facts constitute a dwelling instead of leaving the jury to determine the issue . We therefore reverse the two convictions for Burglary as Class B felonies and remand for the entry of two replacement convictions for Burglary as Class C felonies and for resentencing of the defendant accordingly . As to the defendant 's other six convictions , the Court of Appeals is summarily affirmed . Today we undertake to resolve various disputes between governmental entities in Boone County , Indiana , arising under the Indiana Government Modernization Act , Indiana Code Section 36-1.5-1-1 et seq . We reverse both the trial court 's rejection of the GMA reorganization of Zionsville and Perry Township and its approval of Whitestown 's attempts to annex territory included in the 2014 Zionsville-Perry reorganization plan and territory included in Zionsville 's previous 2010 reorganization . This appeal arises from a declaratory judgment action by the Town of Whitestown , Indiana , and Angel Badillo , a resident of Perry Township , seeking judicial declarations that the Zionsville and Perry Township reorganization is contrary to law ; that if not unlawful , it requires a specific separate approval by each participating township and municipality ; and that the Town of Whitestown may initiate and/or proceed with certain annexations . The Town of Zionsville counter-claimed seeking declaratory judgment in its favor on the same issues and also asserting a breach of an interlocal agreement between the two towns . Acting under the GMA in 2010 , the Town of Zionsville reorganized with the unincorporated areas of Eagle Township and all of Union Township . This reorganization resulted in a new political subdivision , described in the 2010 Reorganization documents as `` one governmental entity to be known as the Town of Zionsville . . . . '' Appellant's App'x at 0294 . The 2010 Reorganization did not include the nearby Town of Whitestown , which before the reorganization was geographically located in parts of Worth , Perry , and Eagle Townships in Boone County , Indiana . On March 26 , 2013 , the Town Council of Whitestown adopted Ordinance 2012-22 ( 2012 Southside Annexation , introduced November 13 , 2012 ) to annex certain territory in Perry Township that included a Whitestown wastewater treatment plant . The landowners filed a remonstrance , and the case is currently pending transfer to this Court in Cause No . 29A05-1409-MI-00437 . On April 18 , 2014 , the Perry Township Advisory Board and the Perry Township Trustee adopted a resolution proposing to reorganize with Zionsville . On April 21 , 2014 , the Zionsville Town Council adopted a resolution to participate in a proposed reorganization with Perry Township . The proposed reorganization between Zionsville and Perry Township did not include Whitestown . On April 22 , 2014 , at a meeting of the Whitestown Town Council , four annexation ordinances ( Ordinances 2014-12 , 2014-13 , 2014-14 , and 2014-15 ) were introduced proposing the annexation of certain territory included in the proposed reorganization between Zionsville and Perry Township and territory already within Zionsville . The Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan was finally adopted by Zionsville and Perry Township on May 20 , 2014 , and was to be submitted to the voters in the two reorganizing political subdivisions in the general election of November 4 , 2014 . On June 25 , 2014 , Whitestown filed a complaint against Zionsville seeking a judgment declaring the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization invalid . Zionsville filed a counterclaim seeking a judicial declaration prohibiting Whitestown from pursuing its attempts to annex territory in Perry Township because the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization was first-intime , and in Zionsville because Whitestown can not annex territory within Zionsville's corporate limits . On cross-motions for summary judgment , the trial court entered summary judgment for Whitestown on October 7 , 2014 . The trial court concluded that : the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization is contrary to the GMA and therefore invalid ; the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization 's proposal for a public vote on the 2014 Plan does not comply with the GMA ; Whitestown has authority to pursue the annexations , and the Town of Whitestown did not breach the interlocal agreement with the Town of Zionsville . The reorganization plan was nevertheless to be submitted at the November 4 , 2014 general election to the voters of the political subdivisions participating in the reorganization . Zionsville initiated this appeal , claiming that it possesses township powers from the predecessor townships of Eagle and Union Townships in the 2010 Reorganization , and thus has the power of a township to merge with Perry Township under the GMA ; alternatively , that if Zionsville could not reorganize with Perry Township as a township itself , then it could reorganize with Perry Township as a town ; that Whitestown as a municipality can not annex territory within Zionsville , a neighboring municipality ; that Whitestown can not annex territory in Perry Township after the reorganization was initiated ; and that the trial court erred in striking down a reorganization between Zionsville and Perry Township `` despite the fact that their elected officials and voters both approved the reorganization . '' Appellant 's Br . at 1 . Whitestown responded to Zionsville 's appellate claims , asserting : that the GMA does not permit Zionsville to reorganize with Perry Township because Zionsville `` is separated from Perry Township by Whitestown , '' and thus is not adjacent to Perry Township , Appellee 's Br . at 1 ; that the voting blocs Zionsville directed in its 2014 reorganization plan do not comply with the GMA 's requirements ; and that Zionsville can not use the GMA to block Whitestown from completing first-in-time annexations in Perry Township or in areas where Zionsville purports to act as a township but in which Whitestown provides municipal services . Whitestown asks this Court to affirm the trial court 's order , which concluded that Zionsville may not reorganize with Perry Township as `` [ t ] he Perry Plan 's voting districts are not consistent with the requirements of the [ GMA ] , '' and `` Whitestown may proceed with its earlier initiated annexations . . . . '' Appellant 's App'x at 26 , 31 . The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court . Town of Zionsville v. Town of Whitestown , 33 N.E.3d 1144 , 1155 . Whitestown sought transfer . Numerous Indiana cities and towns have filed briefs as amicus curiae.2 We granted transfer . The principal issue in this appeal is the correctness of the trial court 's ruling on the parties ' competing summary judgment motions on the same issues . The parties disagree regarding issues of statutory construction and application , but the relevant facts are not in dispute . Because this appeal presents only issues of law , our review is de novo . See Cavens v. Zaberdac , 849 N.E.2d 526 , 529 . Consolidating the parties ' claims , this appeal presents the following principal issues : Did the 2010 Reorganization of Zionsville with Union and Eagle Townships empower Zionsville to subsequently reorganize with Perry Township ? Was the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization structurally defective ? Was Whitestown entitled to annex territory included in the proposed 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization or in Zionsville 's completed 2010 Reorganization ? In 2010 several Boone County government entities reorganized under the GMA . The reorganization included the `` unincorporated portions of Eagle Township , all of Union Township , and the current Town of Zionsville . . . . '' Appellant 's App'x at 0056 . The 2010 Reorganization excluded the incorporated portion of Eagle Township consisting of portions of the Town of Whitestown . The reorganization explicitly stated that the resulting governmental entity `` known as the Town of Zionsville , '' id. , `` shall be governed and administered as a 'town ' as that term is defined under Indiana law . '' Id . at 0058 . In this appeal the parties dispute whether the resulting reorganized Zionsville was thereafter empowered to further reorganize with other townships under the GMA . We must determine whether Zionsville , as a new political subdivision that identifies itself as a town and claims township powers , is authorized to further reorganize with another township under the GMA . The Indiana General Assembly enacted the GMA in 2006 expressly designating among its purposes to : `` [ g ] rant broad powers to enable political subdivisions to operate more efficiently by eliminating restrictions under existing law that : impede the economy of operation of ; interfere with the ease of administration of ; inhibit cooperation among ; and thwart better government by ; political subdivisions . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-1-1 . 3 Under the GMA , eleven various sets of political subdivisions are authorized to reorganize , including : Two or more townships located entirely within the same county . A township reorganizing under this subdivision must be adjacent to at least one other township participating in the reorganization . * * * A township and a municipality that is located in any part of the same township . Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-1 . In prescribing the powers of a resulting governmental entity , the Act expressly declared : A reorganized political subdivision has the powers granted by statute to a political subdivision of the same type as the reorganized political subdivision . However , if authorized by the plan of reorganization approved by the voters in a public question under this chapter , the reorganized political subdivision will exercise a power or have the officers or number of offices that a statute would have permitted any of the reorganizing political subdivisions to have . Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-38 . An expansive application of the GMA is expressly directed : '' [ T ] o the extent the provisions of this article are inconsistent with the provisions of any other general , special , or local law , the provisions of this article are controlling , and compliance with this article shall be treated as compliance with the conflicting law . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-1-6.4 The GMA instructs that its provisions must be `` liberally construed to effect [ its ] purposes . . . . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-1-5 . In 2012 this Court extensively reviewed the nature and effect of the GMA , finding that it was enacted in 2006 to liberalize `` the framework within which local governments may reorganize themselves . '' Kole v. Faultless , 963 N.E.2d 493 , 494 . The GMA framework `` substantially reduces the barriers to rearranging local units '' id , and granted political subdivisions `` 'full and complete authority ' to reorganize , exercise governmental functions under a cooperative agreement , and transfer responsibilities between offices and officers . '' Id at 496 . Under the GMA , `` [ a ] reorganization includes a change in the structure or administration of a political subdivision . . . . '' Id . We emphasized in Kole that , regardless of the political subdivisions involved in a reorganization , the GMA `` does not , at least by its terms , limit the resulting forms the reorganized political subdivision may take . '' Id . at 497 . Kole further explained that , because the GMA specifically directs that it be liberally construed and fully authorizes the reorganization of political subdivisions , `` nontraditional '' political subdivisions may emerge after reorganization . See Kole , 963 N.E.2d at 495 ( approving a new political subdivision , the City of Fishers , which `` would become a 'nontraditional ' second class city that combined attributes of a second class city and a town '' ) . The 2010 Reorganization plan expressly directed that Zionsville , as the resulting entity , was to be governed and administered as a town under Indiana law . Thus it had the powers granted by statute to a town . Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-38 . In addition to these powers the GMA authorized a reorganized political subdivision to `` exercise a power . . . that a statute would have permitted any of the organizing political subdivisions to have '' but only `` if authorized by the plan of reorganization approved by the voters in a public question under this chapter . . . . '' Id . The 2010 Reorganization plan specified that the powers of the resulting Town of Zionsville5 would include the `` powers , rights , and duties '' of Eagle and Union Townships as follows : Township Duties Transferred . As of the Effective Date , the offices described in Ind . Code _ 36-6 et . seq. , including , but not limited to , the township trustee and the township board , shall cease to exist and are abolished , and the powers , rights , and duties described in Ind . Code _ 36-6 et . seq . shall be transferred in the manner set forth herein or as determined by the New Town Council . Joint Resolution No . 2008-02 of the Eagle Township Board , Joint Resolution No . 2008-01 of the Union Township Board , Ordinance No . 2008-12 of the Town of Zionsville , Indiana , 6-7 . Whitestown does not dispute the adoption of this joint resolution nor the approval of the 2010 Reorganization by a majority of the voters . As noted above , the GMA provision authorizing a reorganized government entity to exercise the powers of the organizing entities is qualified by the phrase `` if authorized by the plan of reorganization . . . . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-38 . Whitestown argues that under the language of the 2010 Reorganization plan the powers transferred to Zionsville included only `` the powers , rights , and duties described in Ind . Code _ 36-6 et seq . '' Appellee 's Br . at 21 ( quoting Appellant 's App'x at 0298 ) . The provisions of Title 36 , Article 6 do not include the specific power to reorganize as a township found in the GMA at Title 36 , Article 1.5 . Significantly , however , the GMA directs its own expansive and controlling application : A political subdivision may exercise the powers granted under this article to reorganize or enter into cooperative agreements without complying with the provisions of any other law , statute , or rule . Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-1-4 . The Act further states : `` This article shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes of this article . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-1-5 . Similarly : Except as otherwise specifically provided by law , to the extent the provisions of this article are inconsistent with the provisions of any other general , special , or local law , the provisions of this article are controlling , and compliance with this article shall be treated as compliance with the conflicting law . Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-1-6 . As explained in Kole , the GMA granted political subdivisions `` 'full and complete authority ' '' to reorganize and exercise governmental functions . 963 N.E.2d at 496 . In Kole , this Court also reviewed Indiana 's history relating to the powers local government had as being limited to only those powers specifically listed , and how the General Assembly has been actively moving away from that limitation since the 1970's and into the Twenty-First Century . Id . at 496 . We observed : [ I ] t is far less burdensome on both the courts and the Legislature for the law to presume the existence of local authority to act absent some express prohibition , than it is to require legislation spelling out every detail of every permissible action a municipality may take . So the General Assembly has said , several times over multiple recent decades . Kole , 963 N.E.2d at 498 . In light of these considerations , we decline to restrictively interpret the GMA 's application to the 2010 Reorganization plan so as to limit Zionsville 's exercise of general township powers , including the power to further reorganize pursuant to the GMA . We acknowledge the vigorous arguments of Whitestown cautioning against potential challenges related to traditional concepts of governance and the allocation and assumption of township services , particularly with respect to the Whitestown residents located in the former Eagle Township . Issues of effective municipal governance are policy matters to be determined by legislative formulation , not by judicial intrusion . We conclude that the legislature , in crafting the GMA , envisioned and authorized reorganized political entities to assume all of the functions and to exercise all of the powers of the entities participating in the reorganization . This understanding is enhanced by the legislature 's later declaration that `` a reorganized political subdivision that results from a reorganization under this chapter must continue to carry out the duties imposed by Indiana law on the reorganizing political subdivisions that combined to form the reorganized political subdivision . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-39 . Whitestown also argues that the GMA `` permits two adjacent 'townships ' to reorganize together , '' but `` does not permit a township and a town with some township powers to do so . '' Appellee 's Br . at 20 ) . This is because , Whitestown argues , `` the Legislature did not say that a municipality with 'substantially equivalent powers ' to a township could reorganize as if it were a township . '' Id . at 20 n.4 . We reject this argument because the ability to reorganize under section 36-1.5-4-1 is itself a township power_specifically the power to `` reorganize under this chapter . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-1 . As explained above , the GMA expressly authorizes a reorganized political subdivision to `` exercise a power . . . that a statute would have permitted any of the reorganizing political subdivisions to have . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-38 . The fact that the reorganized Town of Zionsville included all of Eagle Township except portions within the municipal boundaries of Whitestown does not preclude the transfer to Zionsville of all of the township powers of the former Eagle Township . Whitestown concedes that `` [ n ] o one disputes that Zionsville is required to provide township services in all of the former Eagle Township and that [ it ] possesses the power to do so . '' Appellee 's Br . at 23 . We find that the GMA authorized the transfer of all township powers from Eagle and Union Townships to the resulting 2010 reorganized Zionsville . We conclude that the township powers of Eagle and Union Townships , including the power to reorganize with another township under the GMA , were transferred to the reorganized Town of Zionsville as a result of the 2010 Reorganization , enabling Zionsville to seek further government reorganization under the GMA . The GMA provides that , in order for two townships to reorganize into one political entity , they `` must be adjacent . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-1 . The GMA further explains this requirement : `` [ T ] wo political subdivisions may not be treated as adjacent if the political subdivisions are connected by a strip of land that is less than one hundred fifty feet wide . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-2 . Prior to its 2010 Reorganization Zionsville was entirely located within Eagle Township . In 2010 , however , it reorganized to include all the unincorporated areas of Eagle and Union Townships . The only area within the two Townships excluded from this reorganization was part of the Town of Whitestown within Eagle Township , which was the only incorporated area in such townships . Before the 2010 Reorganization , a portion of the Town of Whitestown was located between Zionsville and Perry Township . While the municipal limits of Whitestown included land along a significant portion of the west border of Eagle Township , Whitestown did not include a small rectangular parcel at the southwest corner of the former Eagle Township that , for a distance of over 1300 feet , shared a common boundary with Perry Township . While a portion of Whitestown separated this small parcel from the rest of Zionsville , the parcel was itself an unincorporated part of the former Eagle Township and thus under the 2010 Zionsville reorganization became a part of the resulting reorganized Town of Zionsville . This small parcel is the only territory included in the 2010 Reorganization that is adjacent to Perry Township , and it serves as the basis for the reorganized Town of Zionsville's claim that it satisfies the GMA requirement that reorganizing townships must be adjacent.6 The following graphic prepared by the Court depicts the location of the small parcel in relation to the boundaries of Perry Township , Whitestown , and the main body of Zionsville . While we do not find a separate legal description for the parcel in the record , the maps accompanying the 2010 Reorganization identified it as part of the rural , unincorporated territory of Eagle Township included in the reorganization . In 2014 Whitestown sought to annex a specifically identified seventy acre area , which included this small parcel of formerly unincorporated Eagle Township now a part of Zionsville . Whitestown thereby implicitly acknowledged that this sub-parcel was not already a part of Whitestown and identified it as located in the former Eagle Township . This former Eagle Township parcel coincides with the parcel of unincorporated Eagle Township territory included in the 2010 Reorganization plan . From the legal description of the seventy acres sought to be annexed by Whitestown , it is clear that the small parcel of reorganized Zionsville was adjacent to Perry Township for a distance of at least 1300 feet . Whitestown , however , urges that governmental reorganization under the GMA should not be applied to permit a municipality to be comprised of separated parcels , emphasizing that the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization would result in Zionsville being divided into two geographical territories separated by a portion of Whitestown . While not disputing that the small parcel adjoins Perry Township for more than 150 feet , Whitestown argues that the parcel `` is not contiguous with the remainder of [ reorganized ] Zionsville and may not form a basis for establishing adjacency '' because it is separated by Whitestown . Appellee 's Br . at 29 . Whitestown contends that permitting Zionsville to reorganize with Perry Township based on their common border for more than 150 feet allows Zionsville , or any other municipality , to use a previously acquired `` small , isolated , island of land '' as a `` springboard to extend its municipal boundaries to an area entirely separated '' from the rest of its territory by another municipality . Appellee 's Br . at 30 . Whitestown urges that the GMA adjacency requirement should be interpreted to prohibit `` leap-frogging , '' Appellee 's Pet . to Tr . at 12 , which is contrary to the `` idea of a municipal corporation . . . [ ] that of oneness , community , locality , vicinity ; a collective body of inhabitants'that is , a body of people collected or gathered together in one mass , not separated into distinct masses . . . '' Appellee 's Br . at 30 ( quoting Town of Dyer v. Town of St. John , 919 N.E.2d 1196 , 1202 ) ; see also Amici Batesville 's Br . at 7 . From its statutory language , however , the GMA clearly permits the reorganization of political subdivisions that are `` adjacent '' in the sense that they are `` connected by a strip of land that is [ not ] less than one hundred fifty feet wide . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4- 2 . The GMA does not mandate that a reorganized political subdivision be wholly interconnected without physical separation . Because the parcel in the southwest corner of reorganized Zionsville provides over 150 feet of adjacency to Perry Township , the GMA 's adjacency requirement is satisfied . In its reply brief in support of petition to transfer , Whitestown also asks us to import a requirement that certain annexed territory be `` contiguous '' under Indiana Code _ 36-4-3-1.5 . Because this issue was raised for the first time in two cursory sentences in Whitestown 's reply brief to petition to transfer , we deem it waived . State v. Holtsclaw , 977 N.E.2d 348 , 350-51 ( Ind . 2012 ) ) ; Ind . App . R. 57 . Notwithstanding waiver , however , we disapprove the argument . In this claim , Whitestown argues that the GMA in sections 36-1.5- 4-37 and 36-1.5-4-39 imports from the statutory provisions governing annexation the requirement that a territory being annexed be `` contiguous , '' that is , `` at least one-eighth of the aggregate external boundaries of the territory '' being annexed must `` coincide [ ] with the boundaries of the annexing municipality . '' Ind . Code _ 36-4-3-1.5 . Those GMA sections , however , do not apply here . Whitestown 's rights are not affected by either the 2014 Zionsville Perry Reorganization or the 2010 Reorganization . See Ind . Code __ 36-1.5-4-1 , -38 . Neither of Zionsville 's reorganizations presents any incursion into the municipal boundaries of Whitestown and thus do not substantively impair Whitestown 's rights . In adopting the GMA in 2006 , the legislature chose to require only 150 feet of adjacency , Ind . Code _ 36- 1.5-4-2 , not the contiguity required for annexation , Ind . Code _ 36-4-3-1.5 . We decline to judicially superimpose on the GMA the contiguity requirements of the statutory annexation procedure . It is undisputed that the small parcel , which was part of the unincorporated area of Eagle Township before the 2010 Reorganization , thereafter became part of the resulting reorganized governmental entity known as the Town of Zionsville . We thus conclude that reorganized Zionsville , acting with the powers of a township transferred to it in the 2010 Reorganization , was adjacent to Perry Township by more than 150 feet in 2014 and thereby was eligible to reorganize with Perry Township under the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan . Because we find that Zionsville , in the exercise of township powers transferred to it as a result of the 2010 Reorganization plan , is authorized to seek further reorganization under the GMA , we decline to address Zionsville 's alternative claim that , in addition to its power to act with the powers of a township , it may also reorganize with Perry Township under its town status as a municipality under Indiana Code Section 36-1.5-4-1,7 which does not require that the two entities be adjacent to each other , but rather that the municipality be `` located in any part of the same township . '' Zionsville argues that following its 2010 Reorganization it became a part of Perry Township as the least-populated , contiguous township to itself under Indiana Code _ 36-6- 1-12 ,8 and thus , if found to lack the powers of a township to further reorganize , could alternatively reorganize with Perry Township as a municipality within the township . We need not consider this alternative argument . Whitestown also challenges the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization on grounds that the plan 's voting areas do not comply with GMA requirements . In a reorganization under Indiana Code _ 36-1.5-4-1 , the GMA requires that a `` majority of the voters in each reorganizing political subdivision '' must `` approve . . . the reorganization . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-32 . Whitestown argues that the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization failed to satisfy the following statutory requirement : If a reorganizing political subdivision includes the territory of another reorganizing political subdivision , the vote of voters of a reorganizing political subdivision who also are voters in a second reorganizing political subdivision that is geographically larger than the first political subdivision and that includes the territory of the first political subdivision shall be included only in the tally of votes for the first reorganizing political subdivision in which the voters reside . Ind . Code _36-1.5-4-32 .9 Whitestown urges that this provision requires a separate voting tally for voters in each of the former townships and municipalities that comprised the 2010 Reorganization . We disagree . As applied to the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization , the phrase `` each reorganizing political subdivision , '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-32 , includes only two units : the reorganizing portions of Perry Township10 and the previously reorganized Town of Zionsville . These two reorganizing units do not overlap , and thus the GMA provision regarding territory situated in more than one reorganizing political subdivision is not applicable . See Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4- 32 .11 The 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan is not invalid because of its failure to require a separate voting tally for each of the political subdivisions participating in the 2010 Reorganization . Whitestown does not dispute that the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan was submitted to the voters of Zionsville and the reorganizing portions of Perry Township , but rather it claims that the resulting election was meaningless because it occurred after the trial court 's order declaring the reorganization and its voting areas to be invalid . While ruling that Zionsville and Perry Township can not reorganize and that the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan was invalid , the trial court did not order removal of the reorganization question from the ballot . On October 7 , 2014 , the same day that the trial court order was issued , Zionsville filed its motion to stay the order and allow the November 4th ballot question on the reorganization , but the trial court denied the stay . Whitestown did not seek , and the trial court did not order , removal of the question from the November 4 , 2014 general ballot . Whitestown explained : `` The Perry Plan is already on the ballots , voters are already voting on it , and Whitestown has not moved to have it removed because it is impossible to do so given that early voting has already begun . '' Appellant 's App'x at 0681 . Whitestown now contends that the November vote on the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization is `` meaningless '' because voters can not `` approve an illegal and void public question '' as a matter of law . Appellee 's Br . at 41 . In addition , Whitestown suggests that the election results are unreliable because the trial court's decision invalidating the reorganization may have minimized election participation from voters who might otherwise have voted `` no '' on the ballot question . The effect of the 2014 general election vote on the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization was not an issue in the summary judgment proceedings in the trial court . The election occurred one month after the trial court issued the ruling on appeal . Details regarding the election administration and results are not presented in any of the designated evidence . The facts and circumstances of this election arose after the entry of the trial court order that is the subject of this appeal . The effect of the trial court judgment on the ensuing 2014 general election reorganization plan vote is not before this Court for resolution in this appeal . In granting Whitestown 's motion for summary judgment , the trial court not only found the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization to be invalid but also concluded that neither the 2010 nor the 2014 Zionsville reorganizations , even if valid , prohibited Whitestown 's annexations . The trial court authorized Whitestown to proceed with annexations not only as to territory within the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization but also as to territory within the 2010 Reorganization . Zionsville challenges these determinations on appeal , alternatively arguing that Indiana law prohibits annexations by one municipality within the borders of another , and that Whitestown failed to timely initiate the proposed annexations . A resolution authorizing Zionsville and Perry Township to participate in a proposed reorganization was passed on April 18 , 2014 by the Perry Township Trustee and the Perry Township Advisory Board and on April 21 , 2014 by the Zionsville Town Council . The next day , April 22 , 2014 , four proposed annexation resolutions were introduced at the Whitestown Town Council . Two of the proposed Whitestown annexations involved only Perry Township territory included in the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization , one included only territory within the boundaries of Zionsville as reorganized in 2010 , and one included territory both from Zionsville 's 2010 Reorganization and from the proposed 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization.13 The 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan was finally adopted by Zionsville and Perry Township on May 20 , 2014 . Zionsville and Whitestown dispute whether the Whitestown annexation proceedings are prohibited under Indiana 's statutory municipal annexation statutes that declare `` a municipality may not annex territory that is inside the corporate boundaries of another municipality . . . . '' Ind . Code _ 36-4-3-2 . Whitestown argues that Zionsville should not be considered `` another municipality '' because it `` has been acting as a township '' rather than a town since its 2010 Reorganization , and the annexation statutes defer to the GMA provision permitting annexation of territory within a township after the lapse of a time period that has occurred . Appellee 's Br . at 54-55 . The 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan expressly declared that , upon approval of the plan , the resulting reorganized political subdivision `` shall be known as the Town of Zionsville , a municipality . '' Appellant 's App'x at 0350 . Under the plan , all of the unincorporated territory in the former Perry Township included in the reorganization was to become a part of the new municipality of Zionsville and to be included within its corporate boundaries . We find that the subsequent exercise of township powers by Zionsville as authorized by the GMA does not change its status from a town to a township , nor does such exercise of township powers diminish its protection as a municipality under Indiana Code Section 36-4-3-2 from invasive annexations . All territory within reorganized Zionsville , including the former Perry , Eagle , and Union Township territories , whether through the 2010 Reorganization or through the 2014 Zionsville- Perry Reorganization , would thereby fall within the new corporate boundaries of reorganized Zionsville and thus be shielded from annexation by Indiana Code Section 36-4-3-2 . Whitestown asserts that its right to annex is governed instead by a new provision in Indiana 's municipal annexation statutes that , as applied to the present parties , provides : `` If a township is a participant in a proposed reorganization . . . , a municipality may not adopt an annexation ordinance annexing territory within the township within the period set forth in IC 36- 1.5-4-45 . '' Ind . Code _ 36-4-3-1.4 . Whitestown observes that this time period `` had already elapsed , '' Appellee 's Br . at 55 , thus implying that all the annexations may proceed . This municipal annexation time period references a time period in a corollary provision in the GMA , which provides in relevant part : A political subdivision may not take any of the following actions partially or wholly within a reorganizing political subdivision after the date on which a plan of reorganization is finally adopted by all reorganizing political subdivisions unless all reorganizing political subdivisions agree by adopting identical resolutions : Initiate an annexation of territory . Establish a fire protection territory or fire protection district . Extend water , sewer , or any other infrastructure to the political subdivision . Expand zoning jurisdiction under IC 36-7-4-205 . * * * If a reorganization is approved by the voters under section 34 of this chapter,15 a political subdivision may not take an action under subsection until the earlier of the following : The plan of reorganization has been implemented . One year after the date on which the reorganization is approved under section 34 of this chapter . Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-45 . Thus the interim prohibition of annexation of territory in townships participating in a proposed GMA reorganization , Indiana Code Section 36- 4-3-1.4 , would expire upon the implementation of a GMA reorganization or one year after the date of its approval by voters , whichever is earlier . Section 1.4 is not limited to the initiation of annexation attempts , but explicitly prohibits any final adoption of `` an annexation ordinance annexing territory within the township . . . . '' Ind . Code _ 36-4-3-1.4 . In the present case , Perry Township became a participant in a proposed reorganization with Zionsville on April 21 , 2014 , when both Zionsville and Perry Township had adopted reciprocal resolutions to prepare a plan of reorganization . Such plan was finally adopted by the reorganizing political subdivisions on May 20 , 2014 and was to be submitted to the voters in the reorganizing political subdivisions in the general election of November 4 , 2014.16 The plan specified an effective date of January 1 , 2015 . Assuming its approval in the 2014 general election , the interim prohibition on annexation of territory in a reorganizing township expired January 1 , 2015 , the plan 's implementation date . Whitestown is correct that the interim prohibition against its annexation of Perry Township territory elapsed . But Whitestown does not claim that it thereafter completed the adoption of any of its disputed annexation ordinances annexing territory in Perry Township or in reorganized Zionsville . To the contrary , Perry Township became a part of the municipality of Zionsville on the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization plan 's effective date of January 1 , 2015 . From that point forward , Indiana Code Section 36-4-3-2 protected it from Whitestown 's attempted annexations . We conclude that Section 36-4-3-2 of the municipal annexation statutes prohibits Whitestown from annexing territory within former townships reorganized with the Town of Zionsville in 2010 and from annexing territory in Perry Township included in the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization . Notwithstanding such prohibitions against annexation , however , Whitestown argues that first-in-time principles allow it to complete its 2014 proposed annexations . As this Court has long held , `` [ t ] he first-in-time jurisdictional rule applies 'when there exist two tribunals possessing concurrent and complete jurisdiction of a subject-matter . ' '' Brenwick Assocs. , LLC v. Boone Cty . Redev . Comm'n. , 889 N.E.2d 289 , 294 ( quoting Taylor v. City of Ft. Wayne , 47 Ind . 274 , 282 ) . Whitestown specifically argues that because it `` initiated its annexations when it introduced the ordinances at a public council meeting [ on April 22 , 2014 ] . . . . it had exclusive authority to proceed on them , and neither [ the GMA ] nor the Perry Plan prevented its annexations . '' Appellee 's Br . at 45 . Zionsville argues alternatively that the mere introduction of the annexation ordinances was insufficient to initiate exclusive jurisdiction under the first-in-time rule , and even if Whitestown did initiate its annexations , `` Perry Township and Zionsville took the steps necessary to initiate the Perry Reorganization before Whitestown even introduced its annexation ordinance . '' Appellant 's Br . at 41 . The parties thus dispute what constitutes an `` initiation '' under the first-in-time rule , and which party was first to initiate . It is undisputed that Perry Township and Zionsville both resolved to pursue reorganization on April 18 , 2014 , and April 21 , 2014 , respectively , and that annexation ordinances were introduced at the Whitestown Town Council meeting on April 22 , 2014 . As to Perry Township and Zionsville , the point in time of `` initiation '' is resolved by the GMA itself , which declares , `` [ t ] he legislative body of a political subdivision may initiate a proposed reorganization under this chapter by adopting a resolution that : proposes a reorganization ; and names the political subdivisions that would be reorganized in the proposed reorganization . '' Ind . Code _ 36-1.5-4-10 . The resolutions of Zionsville and Perry Township meet these requirements . The resolution adopted by Zionsville was titled `` A Resolution of the Zionsville Town Council to Participate in the Proposed Reorganization with Perry Township . . . . '' Appellant 's App'x at 0344 . That resolution also noted that `` the Board of Perry Township unanimously adopted Resolution No . 2014-01 on April 18 , 2014 proposing a reorganization with the Town [ of Zionsville ] . . . . '' Id . . Zionsville 's Town Council further resolved that `` the Town of Zionsville and Perry Township . . . shall reorganize and/or enter into a cooperative agreement '' and that `` [ t ] he legislative bodies of Perry Township and the Town of Zionsville shall prepare a plan of reorganization . . . . '' Id . This resolution recognized Perry Township 's proposal of reorganization , resolved to participate in that reorganization , and specifically identified at several points that the reorganizing entities were Zionsville and Perry Township . Whitestown argues that the resolution did not initiate reorganization because `` Zionsville and Perry Township had not resolved to reorganize because they were alternatively pursuing a cooperative agreement . '' Appellee 's Br . at 49 . The GMA 's language is clear , however , that to initiate a reorganization , all that is required is for a political subdivision to adopt a resolution proposing a reorganization and naming the other participating political subdivision . The Perry Township/Zionsville resolutions met these requirements , and the included alternative option to enter into a cooperative agreement has no bearing under the statute.17 Thus , regardless of whether the introduction of the proposed annexation ordinances at the Whitestown Town Council constituted an `` initiation , '' the reorganization of Zionsville and Perry Township was initiated first-in-time . We therefore conclude that , under the first-in-time rule , Whitestown may not complete its proposed annexations of territory in the former Eagle Township reorganized with Zionsville in 2010 , nor complete its proposed annexations of Perry Township territory included in the reorganized Zionsville that results from the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization . The parties ' opposing motions for summary judgment presented the trial court with competing claims as to the power of Zionsville to engage with Perry Township in a reorganization under the Government Modernization Act , as to the power of Whitestown to annex Perry Township territory within such reorganization , and also as to the power of Whitestown to annex territory within Zionsville 's 2010 Reorganization . These competing claims present issues of law , and we now hold that the 2014 Zionsville-Perry Reorganization is not prohibited and that Whitestown may not adopt annexation ordinances annexing territory in municipalities that are the result of completed reorganizations under the Act . The judgment of the trial court is reversed . This cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion . In August 2012 , Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Officer Phillip Robinett conducted a routine traffic stop . Upon making the stop , he discovered that the driver , Antonio Garcia , was driving without a valid driver's license . Garcia was lawfully placed under arrest . Before Officer Robinett placed Garcia in his police cruiser to be transported to the police station , he conducted a quick pat-down search of Garcia's clothing in order to check for weapons . A cylinder-shaped pill container was found in Garcia's pocket . Officer Robinett opened the container to check what it contained . The content was later confirmed to be a single narcotic pill , which Garcia did not have a valid prescription for . Garcia was charged with driving without a license and possession of a controlled substance . At trial , Garcia sought to suppress the admission of the pill container and its contents as the fruit of an unlawful search under Article 1 , Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution . It was not disputed that Officer Robinett was free to conduct a warrantless pat-down search of Garcia's person incident to his arrest . Rather , Garcia only challenged the opening of the pill container as being an unreasonable search . We disagree with Garcia's contention that opening the pill container during the course of the pat-down search incident to his arrest constituted an unreasonable search . As such , we affirm the trial court's denial of Garcia's motion to suppress and hold that the search of Garcia incident to his arrest was reasonable under Article 1 , Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution . On August 6 , 2012 , Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Officer Phillip Robinett observed a vehicle driving without headlights at approximately 9:00 p.m . Officer Robinett turned his police cruiser around to initiate a traffic stop . The vehicle then turned without signaling into a parking spot , even prior to Officer Robinett activating the police cruiser lights and sirens . Upon approaching the vehicle , Officer Robinett requested a driver's license from the vehicle driver . The driver , who was later identified as Antonio Garcia , only had an identification card from a foreign country . Officer Robinett confirmed that Garcia did not hold a valid driver's license , and he initiated an arrest for driving without a license . Incident to the arrest , Officer Robinett conducted a pat-down search of Garcia to check for weapons . No weapons were found during the search , but a silver cylinder-shaped container was recovered from Garcia's front left pocket . Through his work as a police officer , Officer Robinett had encountered similar containers and recognized that it likely contained either an illegal substance or properly prescribed prescriptions . Upon opening the container , Officer Robinett found a single pill . Garcia was taken into custody , and his vehicle was towed . The cylinder was delivered to the police department property room , and the contents of the container , a single pill , was later submitted to the crime lab for testing . The crime lab report indicated that the pill contained Hydrocodone . Garcia did not have a valid prescription for this medication . Garcia was charged with possession of a controlled substance1 and with operating a vehicle without a driver's license.2 A bench trial was held . At trial , the defense made a motion to suppress the cylinder container and its contents from being admitted into evidence . The defense asserted that Officer Robinett did not have the authority to open the container , but conceded that the container could have been seized as a search incident to arrest . The State opposed the motion , relying upon U.S. v. Robinson , 414 U.S. 218 , to argue that opening the container found on Garcia's person was a permissible warrantless search incident to arrest . At trial , Garcia testified that he had been living with his wife , his wife's aunt , and child . Only three days prior to the traffic stop , his wife's aunt had passed away . Garcia explained that the cylinder container was only in his possession because that morning he had been cleaning out the bedroom of his wife's recently deceased Aunt , and he had found the container . He believed it could contain pills , but Garcia never looked inside the container . He had picked it up to keep it out of reach from his young son . Contrary to this account , Officer Robinett testified that after he found the pill inside the container Garcia voluntarily stated that the pill was his 'narcotic for pain.' There were no other testifying witnesses . After both the State and Defense rested , defense counsel conceded to the fact that Garcia was driving without a license . Then , the trial court returned to the issue of whether the cylinder container should be suppressed , noting that the Robinson case seemed to be 'on point.' The defense argued that the contents of the container was not obviously contraband , there was no concern for officer safety , no exigent circumstances , and a warrant could have been obtained if the police wanted to examine the contents of the container . The court denied the motion to suppress the container , finding Robinson controlling . Garcia was found guilty of possessing a controlled substance and driving while never receiving a license . Garcia was sentenced to 180 days in Marion County jail with 176 days suspended . Garcia appealed , asserting that the search of the container was outside the scope of a permissible search incident to arrest and was unreasonable under Article 1 , Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution . The Court of Appeals agreed with Garcia . Garcia v. State , 25 N.E.3d 786 . In reaching this decision , the court applied the Litchfield v. State , 824 N.E.2d 356 , 361 , factors 'to the search of the container.' Id . at 790 . The court reasoned that the degree of suspicion that a criminal violation had occurred was low , both arguments about the degree of intrusion were meritorious , and the need of law enforcement was also low given that there was no concern for officer safety or suspicion of criminal activity . Id . Thus , it was unreasonable to open the container found in Garcia's pocket during a search incident to arrest . Id . at 791 . The pill was inadmissible , and Garcia's conviction for class D felony possession of a schedule III controlled substance was reversed . Id . This Court granted the State's petition for transfer , thereby vacating the Court of Appeals opinion . Ind . Appellate Rule 58 . We affirm the trial court's denial of Garcia's motion to suppress . We hold that the search of the container found on Garcia's person was within the scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest and was reasonable under Article 1 , Section 11 . The standard of review for a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress is similar to other sufficiency issues . Litchfield , 824 N.E.2d at 358 . 'We determine whether substantial evidence of probative value exists to support the trial court's ruling.' Id . Evidence will not be reweighed , and we 'consider conflicting evidence most favorably to the trial court's ruling.' Id . However , this Court reviews de novo a trial court's ruling on the constitutionality of a search or seizure . Belvedere v. State , 889 N.E.2d 286 , 287 . Article 1 , Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution reads : The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable search or seizure , shall not be violated ; and no warrant shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and person or thing to be seized . This Section has long served to protect Hoosiers from unreasonable searches and seizures . Reasonableness of a search under the Indiana Constitution 'turns on an evaluation of the reasonableness of the police conduct under the totality of the circumstances.' Litchfield , 824 N.E.2d at 361 ) . In considering the totality of the circumstances , the perspectives of both the investigating officer and subject of the search are considered . Litchfield , 824 N.E.2d at 360 . Three factors must be balanced : '1 ) the degree of concern , suspicion , or knowledge that a violation has occurred , 2 ) the degree of intrusion the method of the search or seizure imposes on the citizen's ordinary activities , and 3 ) the extent of law enforcement needs.' Id . at 361 . In considering the three Litchfield factors , the context in which the search occurs is highly relevant . As early as 1914 , the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the validity of a search incident to a lawful arrest , noting that the government has 'always recognized under English and American law' that it is permissible 'to search the person of the accused when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime.' Weeks v. U.S. , 232 U.S. 383 , 392 . Likewise , Indiana has also recognized that a search may be conducted 'without a warrant if it is incidental to a lawful arrest.' Townsend v. State , 460 N.E.2d 139 , 141 . In the present case , it is not disputed that Garcia was searched incident to a valid arrest . The question before the Court today goes beyond the general acceptance that a warrantless search incident to a valid arrest is reasonable under both the Fourth Amendment and Article 1 , Section 11 . Garcia does not dispute that the search of his person was permissible as a search incident to arrest . Rather , he challenges the permissible scope of such a search . Garcia contends that while the pill container found on his person during the pat-down search could be seized , a search incident to arrest under Article 1 , Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution does not permit the officer to open the container found on his person without a warrant or reasonable suspicion of illegal activity . After consideration of the three Litchfield factors and federal precedent on this very issue , we disagree . In the present case , opening the container found on Garcia's person during the course of a search incident to a valid arrest was reasonable under the Indiana Constitution . As recited above , the reasonableness of a search requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances , which is done by balancing the three Litchfield factors . Although Garcia puts great emphasis upon the lack of suspicion surrounding the search of the container itself , the degree of suspicion is but one factor to be considered . Additionally , these factors must be considered in light of the fact that the search occurred in the context of a search incident to a lawful arrest , and this Court has long recognized that ' [ a ] search incident to a valid arrest is lawful regardless of what it reveals.' Farrie v. State , 251 Ind . 681 , 683 , 266 N.E.2d 212 , 214 . We address each factor in turn . This factor may be assessed quickly and ultimately falls in favor of the State . We have previously recognized that 'once a lawful arrest has been made , authorities may conduct a 'full search' of the arrestee for weapons or concealed evidence . No additional probable cause for the search is required , and the search incident to arrest may 'involve a relatively extensive exploration of the person.'' Edwards v. State , 759 N.E.2d 626 , 629 . In the present situation , we read Edwards to support the conclusion that Officer Robinett did not need any additional degree of suspicion specifically in relation to the cylinder container found on Garcia in order to open that container incident to Garcia's lawful arrest . Furthermore , as Edwards demonstrates , we have seen fit to consider Robinson on prior occasions when addressing searches incident to arrest . We continue to be persuaded by Robinson regarding the degree of suspicion necessary to conduct a search incident to arrest . The United States Supreme Court set out a clear standard in Robinson . 'A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion . . . that intrusion being lawful , a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.' 414 U.S. at 235 . We similarly conclude that it is 'the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search.'3 Id . Here , Garcia was lawfully placed under arrest for driving his vehicle without a valid driver's license . It is not disputed that the pat-down search of his person incident to his arrest was permissible . Under these circumstances , it is likewise true that no additional suspicion was needed to search the container found in Garcia's pocket during the normal course of the pat-down search . Again , as provided in Edwards , once a lawful arrest occurs , no additional probable cause is necessary to conduct a 'relatively extensive exploration of the person.' 759 N.E.2d at 629 . Thus , the degree of suspicion weighs in favor of the State . Next , we consider the degree to which the search intruded upon Garcia's ordinary activities . In doing so , we continue to look to the totality of the circumstances . First , Garcia had already been subjected to a traffic stop . He was then lawfully arrested , at which time Officer Robinett decided to take him into custody and have his vehicle towed . The brief delay needed to conduct a pat-down search prior to Garcia being taken into custody would have had little to no additional impact on Garcia's ordinary activities , given that he was already being placed under arrest . The arrest alone was a significant intrusion into Garcia's ordinary activities . A pat-down is minimally intrusive in comparison to Garcia being detained , transported to the police station , booked , and held in jail while criminal charges are potentially brought against him . Second , even if the pat-down were considered in isolation , we similarly conclude that the search was minimally intrusive . In Edmond v. State , the Court of Appeals addressed the reasonableness of a search that occurred after a driver was arrested for not having a valid license . 951 N.E.2d 585 , 587 . The police officer planned to have the vehicle towed , and he asked the driver to exit the vehicle . Id . At all times , the driver was cooperative and did not make any threats or furtive movements . Id . The officer conducted a pat-down search of the driver and felt a bulge in his pocket . Id . The officer believed that the bulge could be marijuana , and upon removing the item , discovered a baggie containing a substance that was later confirmed to be marijuana . Id . As a result , the driver was subsequently charged with possession of marijuana . Id . In affirming the reasonableness of the search under Article 1 , Section 11 , the court conceded that 'the search of a person's body is a substantial intrusion.' Id . at 592 . However , 'a police officer is authorized to conduct a thorough search of an arrestee , ' and where the police carry out 'only a pat-down search of [ an arrestee's ] clothing . . . the degree of intrusion [ is ] minimal . . . .' Id . Moreover , the degree of intrusion in the present case is easily distinguishable from the unreasonable search in Edwards , 759 N.E.2d at 629 . Edwards involved the strip search of an arrestee , who had not been charged with any criminal activity , and any charges he potentially faced were all for nonviolent misdemeanor offenses . Id . After considering the highly intrusive nature of being strip searched , the Court concluded that ' [ w ] e do not believe that routine , warrantless strip searches of misdemeanor arrestees , even when incident to lawful arrests , are reasonable . . . .' Id . Edwards exemplifies when a search may be deemed unreasonable and outside the scope of a valid search incident to an arrest . Garcia attempts to argue that only the opening of the pill container should be considered in conducting the reasonableness analysis , and goes on to claim that a pill container is especially private , making the intrusion in opening the container great . We are not persuaded . As Edmond and Edwards demonstrate , it is the type of search , and all of the attendant circumstances , which is relevant to assessing the degree of intrusion . In addition to our own precedent , this conclusion is also supported by the United States Supreme Court , which has directly provided that : A police officer's determination as to how and where to search the person of a suspect whom he has arrested is necessarily a quick ad hoc judgment which the Fourth Amendment does not require to be broken down in each instance into an analysis of each step in the search . Robinson , 414 U.S. at 235 . Again , it is not a single aspect of the search that is considered , but the entirety of the search . Here , Garcia was already subjected to a lawful arrest . The arrest alone would result in Garcia's vehicle being towed and Garcia being detained by police , transported to the police station , booked , and detained at the police station for some additional period of time . The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the intrusive nature of an arrest in Terry v. Ohio by explaining that ' [ a ] n arrest is the initial stage of a criminal prosecution . . . and it is inevitably accompanied by future interference with the individual's freedom of movement , whether or not trial or conviction ultimately follows.' 392 U.S. 1 , 26 . Thus , a brief pat-down search of Garcia's clothing was not an extensive intrusion , especially considering Garcia's arrest . See Stark v. State , 960 N.E.2d 887 , 892 . Because the search of Garcia was brief and minimal , the degree of intrusion also weighs in favor of the State . The needs of law enforcement to conduct a search can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances . Among the most commonly recognized bases for conducting a search includes 'ensuring that the arrestee is unarmed , preventing the arrestee from brining contraband into jail , and preventing the destruction of evidence.' Edmond , 951 N.E.2d at 592. . It is not disputed that Officer Robinett was justified in doing a pat-down search for weapons before placing Garcia into his police cruiser . Officer safety is a paramount concern when an arrestee is taken into custody . Moreover , a search incident to arrest is not limited based on 'an assumption that persons arrested for the offense of driving while their licenses have been revoked are less likely to possess dangerous weapons than are those arrested for other crimes.' Robinson , 414 U.S. at 234 . Rather , 'all custodial arrests [ are treated ] alike for purposes of search justification.' Id . at 235 . When the pill container was discovered on Garcia's person , it is insignificant that Officer Robinett acknowledged that the container could contain legal or illegal substances or that he did not subjectively view Garcia or the container as dangerous . First , we have continually reiterated that ' [ a ] search incident to a valid arrest is lawful regardless of what it reveals.' Farrie , 251 Ind . at 683 , 266 N.E.2d at 214 . Second , the objective reasonableness of the search is controlling , not Officer Robinett's subjective views . Even under a brief stop and frisk , it is well established that the reasonableness of an officer's suspicion turns upon whether 'the totality of the circumstances presented a particularized and objective basis for the officer's belief . . . .' State v. Keck , 4 N.E.3d 1180 , 1184 . Under an objective standard , we agree that 'unknown physical objects may always pose risks , no matter how slight , during the tense atmosphere of a custodial arrest.' Riley v. California , 134 S.Ct . 2473 , 2485 . In fact , these risks continue to some extent into the ensuing time thereafter the arrest . For example , a risk may still exist while police are transporting an arrestee to a secure location and during booking of that individual at the police station . See Chambers v. State , 422 N.E.2d 1198 , 1203 We also seek to reiterate our recent statement in Guilmette . As background , in Guilmette , the defendant challenged the admission of DNA evidence recovered from his shoe because police arrested him for one crime but seized his shoe to search for evidence of a different crime . 14 N.E.3d 38 , 41 . The defendant argued that the DNA test was an unreasonable search incident to arrest . Id . After upholding the DNA testing of the shoe , the Court explained the practical rationalization for allowing the search : ' [ I ] t would be extremely cumbersome to require law enforcement to take the 'belt-and-suspenders' approach of applying for an independent warrant anytime they wish to examine or test a piece of evidence they have already lawfully seized.' Id . at 42 . Similarly , we see no basis in the present circumstances why an independent warrant should be required to search an item already lawfully seized . Thus , we conclude that the final Litchfield factor also weighs in favor of the State . When taking an individual into custody , officer safety is a primary concern . Small and seemingly innocuous items have the potential to pose a threat . We see no reason to delay the officer's ability to inspect such items once they have already been lawfully seized . Although our analysis could conclude here , having found that all three of the Litchfield factors weigh in favor of the State , we find it worth noting other persuasive authority that is consistent with our conclusion . First , this Court has previously upheld , as a valid search incident to arrest , a search that included opening a closed item found on the person of the arrestee . In Chambers , the defendant abducted , sexually assaulted , and then released his victim only after removing her military identification card from her wallet so he could subsequently harass the victim with threatening phone calls . 422 N.E.2d at 1200 . Upon further investigation into this offense , police ultimately arrested the defendant at a local tavern . Id . at 1201 . Once at the police station , the defendant was ordered to hand over the contents of his pockets , and his wallet was searched in the hope of discovering the victim's military identification card . Id . at 1202 . The police instead found a piece of paper with the victim's name , telephone number , and address written on it . Id . The search of the defendant's wallet was upheld as a valid search incident to arrest . Id . at 1203 . Even though the police in Chambers had some degree of suspicion regarding what could have been found in the defendant's wallet , the degree of suspicion was not the basis of the Court's holding . Rather , the court provided that ' [ t ] he search of [ the defendant's ] wallet in the instant case was proper since it was searched as part of a search of his person.' Id . at 1203. 'The search was incident to the arrest since the wallet . . . was immediately associated with the person of the [ arrestee ] .' Id . We decline to reach a different conclusion in the present case . Similar to Chambers , the container found on Garcia's person occurred during a valid search incident to arrest . As such , it was permissible for that container to be opened and the contents examined without going to the extent of obtaining an individual warrant . Additionally , when addressing Fourth Amendment challenges , Indiana courts have upheld searches incident to arrest in which containers found upon the arrestee have been opened . In Klopfenstein v. State , officers detained and arrested the driver and passengers in a vehicle where multiple weapons were in plain view . 439 N.E.2d 1181 , 1184 . When the driver was subjected to a pat-down search , a closed Tylenol pill bottle in a clear plastic bag was discovered . Id . The officer removed and opened the Tylenol bottle . Id . Inside , the officer discovered a greenish substance , later identified as hashish . Id . After considering both U.S. Supreme Court and Indiana precedent , the court concluded that the search of the Tylenol bottle was a valid search of the person incident to arrest . Id . at 1188 . See also Shirley v. State , 803 N.E.2d 251 , 253-54 , 256 ; and Wilson v. State , 754 N.E.2d 950 , 953 , 957 . Finally , the U.S. Supreme Court's clear guidance on this issue in Robinson is also persuasive . In Robinson , police conducted a traffic stop and lawfully arrested the driver for operating a motor vehicle after having his license revoked . 414 U.S. at 220 . Incident to this arrest , police conducted a pat-down search of the individual's clothing , at which time an object was felt in the breast pocket of the individual's coat . Id . at 222-23 . The officer removed the object and discovered that it was a cigarette packet , but at this point , the officer was still unsure what the packet may contain . Id . at 223 . Upon opening the cigarette packet , the officer discovered multiple capsules , which were later determined to be heroin . Id . The Supreme Court first noted that 'a search incident to a lawful arrest is a traditional exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment , ' and encompasses searching the person of the arrestee . Id . at 224 . While many reasons support the validity of a search incident to arrest , the Robinson court disagreed with the 'suggestion that there must be litigated in each case the issue of whether or not there was present one of the reasons supporting the authority for a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest , ' and declined to find 'such a case-by-case adjudication' necessary . Id . at 235 . The authority to search incident to arrest does not depend upon 'what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.' Id . The Court concluded that the arrest gave rise to the authority to search the individual , and 'it is of no moment that [ the officer ] did not indicate any subjective fear of the respondent or that he did not himself suspect that respondent was armed.' Id . at 236 . The discovery of the cigarette packet during the course of the lawful search , 'entitled [ the officer ] to inspect it ; and when his inspection revealed the heroin capsules , he was entitled to seize them as fruits , instrumentalities , or contraband probative of criminal conduct.' Id . . Although the federal interpretation of reasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment is not binding upon this Court's reasonableness analysis under Article 1 , Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution , in the present situation , we reach the same conclusion . Under Article 1 , Section 11 , opening a container found on the person of an arrestee in the course of a search incident to valid arrest will not automatically be deemed unreasonable . In the present case , the search of the container found on Garcia's person during the course of a pat-down search was reasonable under Article 1 , Section 11 . We affirm the trial court's denial of Garcia's motion to suppress the pill container found on his person during a search incident to a valid arrest . In doing so , we hold that the search of Garcia's person , which included opening the container , was within the scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest and reasonable under Article 1 , Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution . After Kastin Slaybaugh was convicted of rape , he moved for mistrial on grounds there had been juror misconduct . His motion asserted that in voir dire , a juror had denied knowing the victim or her family , but Slaybaugh discovered that a relative of the victim was a 'Facebook friend' of that juror . The trial court ordered the juror deposed . The juror testified she was a 2 realtor , had more than 1000 'friends' on Facebook'most of whom she had 'friended' for networking purposes'but she had not recognized the victim's name during voir dire , did not recognize the victim when she testified , and did not know the victim or her family . The trial court determined that the juror had been truthful when answering that she had no knowledge of the victim or her family , and denied Slaybaugh's motion for mistrial . Noting the novel issue involving a juror's 'expansive list of Facebook friends , ' the Court of Appeals affirmed in Slaybaugh v. State , ___ N.E.3d ___ , ___ , 2015 WL 5612205 , *1 . We agree with the result reached by the Court of Appeals , grant transfer , expressly adopt and incorporate by reference the Court of Appeals opinion in accordance with Indiana Appellate Rule 58 , and affirm the trial court . James Beasley appeals his convictions for the murder of James Allen and the attempted murder of Gerald Beamon . For the reasons set forth in our companion decision of Leandrew Beasley v. State , also issued today , we grant transfer and affirm the trial court's admission of Beamon's hearsay testimony regarding statements Allen made to him on the day he died . We find 2 the trial court could have reasonably determined that Allen's statements were against his interests , and were thus admissible pursuant to Indiana Evidence Rule 804 . In all other respects , we summarily affirm the holding of our Court of Appeals below , pursuant to Indiana Appellate Rule 58 . Leandrew Beasley appeals his convictions for the murder of James Allen , the attempted murder of Gerald Beamon , and unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon . We now grant transfer with respect to a single issue raised by Beasley on appeal : whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Beamon's testimony that Allen told Beamon he had shot Beasley the day before Allen's murder , on the grounds his statements 'had so great a tendency . . . to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability' such that 'a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made [ the statement ] only if the person believed it to be true , ' as permitted by Indiana Evidence Rule 804 . We find that it was not error for the trial court to admit Beamon's challenged testimony on that basis , and thus affirm . According to Gerald Beamon's testimony , on the evening of August 2 , 2012 , Leandrew Beasley and Beamon's cousin , James Allen , got into a fight in a garage ; Beasley pulled a gun , Allen made a grab for it , and during the struggle , Beasley was shot in the face once , after which the gun would no longer discharge . Three other men , whom Allen identified as Levi , Little Billy , and 'J Rock' , were also present at the altercation ; Beamon was not . Allen then spent the night at a hotel room with his girlfriend , Shantell Williams , and the couple checked in under her name . Both Allen and Williams maintained permanent housing at that time ; no explanation appears in the record for why they stayed at a hotel that night . Beasley was treated for a gunshot wound to the face at a nearby hospital that evening , which was described by interviewing police officers as a 'graze.' Tr . at 628 . Beasley did not implicate Allen in the shooting , instead stating that he was attacked while walking home . Police found no evidence of the shooting at the location where Beasley claimed he had been attacked . The next day , Allen and Williams drove to Beamon's house . Williams waited in the car while Allen told Beamon about the fight . All three then left together to pick up some of Allen's things from his apartment and move them into Williams's apartment , and discovered Allen's home had been ransacked . Beamon and Allen also observed bullet holes in Allen's front porch . The group then went to Williams's friend's house , and Allen showed Beamon pictures of the men present in the garage the night before , including Beasley . Beamon had no prior familiarity with Beasley , and studied the photos for about ten minutes . Beamon , Allen , and Williams then drove to Williams's apartment . Williams went inside while Allen and Beamon began to unload Allen's things onto the sidewalk . Beamon heard what at first he thought were fireworks , but quickly realized were gunshots , and saw three men approaching the vehicle on foot , firing repeatedly . Allen died on the spot . Beamon sustained multiple gunshot wounds , but still managed to flee , call 911 , and flag down a passing police car . Beamon told the officer that 'Little Rock' and 'J Rock' were two of the shooters , and he was immediately taken to the hospital . Tr . at 398 . After he was hospitalized , he indicated he had recognized Leandrew and James from the photographs Allen had showed him earlier in the day . Police retrieved the photos and returned with three separate photo line-ups , from which Beamon identified Leandrew and James as two of the shooters , and correctly identified who was who based on the information he had previously received from Allen . Leandrew and James Beasley were subsequently charged with murder and attempted murder , and they were tried jointly.1 The court permitted Beamon to testify'over both defendants' repeated hearsay objections'as to what Allen had told Beamon about the altercation between Allen and Leandrew Beasley , as a statement against Allen's penal interest under Indiana Evidence Rule 804 . The jury found Beasley guilty of murder and attempted murder . Beasley appealed , and our Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed his convictions , finding the admission of this hearsay evidence was erroneous , but harmless . Beasley v. State , 30 N.E.3d 56 , 67 . The panel found that the admission of Allen's hearsay statements were not 'facially incriminating' since Allen only described acts of self-defense , and thus the statements did not qualify for a Rule 804 hearsay exception . Id . In support , it discussed Jervis v. State in depth , where this Court found a hearsay statement was properly excluded from admission as a statement against penal interest when it was 'uncorroborated , only marginally against penal interest , and only marginally relevant.' Id . at 65_67 ) . Nevertheless , the panel found this error to be harmless , as there were independent non-hearsay grounds for the conviction , specifically Beamon's identification of the Beasley brothers at trial as two of the shooters . Id . at 67 . We now grant transfer on this issue , vacating that portion of the opinion below . Ind . Appellate Rule 58 . We summarily affirm the remainder of the Court of Appeals decision pursuant to Indiana Appellate Rule 58 . 'Wide discretion is afforded the trial court in ruling on the admissibility and relevancy of evidence.' Nicholson v. State , 963 N.E.2d 1096 , 1099 . Our review is thus limited to determining whether the court abused that discretion . Id . An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is 'clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances and the error affects a party's substantial rights.' Clark v. State , 994 N.E.2d 252 , 260 . We do not reweigh the evidence ; rather , 'we consider only evidence that is either favorable to the ruling or unrefuted and favorable to the defendant.' Pierce v. State , 29 N.E.3d 1258 , 1264 . Beasley contends it was harmful error to admit Beamon's hearsay testimony of Allen's statements to him , because : Allen's statements described acts of self-defense that would not subject him to any criminal liability , and thus their admission under Rule 804 was error ; and since this was the State's only evidence of Beasley's motive , the error was harmful . We agree with Beasley's second contention , in principle . 'While motive is not an element of the crime , the absence of motive is a significant exculpatory factor . . . .' Kiefer v. State , 761 N.E.2d 802 , 806 . Likewise , the inclusion of evidence of motive is likely a significant incriminating factor in the eyes of the jury . Moreover , we can discern no independent evidence in the record to explain why Beasley would have shot Allen and Beamon aside from Beamon's hearsay testimony of the previous night's altercation between Beasley and Allen ; thus , the State's loss of that evidence would almost certainly have made it more difficult to reach a conviction . Beasley is therefore correct that if this testimony were erroneously admitted , it would be grounds for reversal . We do not , however , agree with Beasley's first contention , and we find the trial court was within its discretion in ruling that Allen's statements were against his interests , such that they were admissible hearsay . Indiana Evidence Rule 804 reads , in relevant part : The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness.2 . . . Statement Against Interest . A statement that [ ] a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because , when made , it was so contrary to the declarant's proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarant's claim against someone else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability . . . . Although we have not yet had occasion to review the current version of Rule 804 , we have reviewed prior iterations of this rule , which were substantively the same.3 Most significantly , in Jervis v. State , the defendant wished to introduce hearsay testimony regarding an alternate perpetrator of the murder . 679 N.E.2d at 878 . The statements in question were between Tony Floyd and his coworker , Marilyn Molinet ; Molinet testified that the morning after the victim's body was discovered , Floyd told her that : [ H ] e had gone out 'partying' two nights earlier , picked up a woman at Frenchie's , gone 'riding around' with her , and then 'dumped her off' behind Newburgh Cinema around 3 or 4 a.m. Molinet also testified that Floyd told her that he knew 'the best way to kill a girl' and put his hands around his own neck to indicate strangulation , and that Floyd , who appeared to be 'awful nervous , ' asked Molinet to be on the lookout for 'detective cars.' Id . We found the trial court was within its discretion in determining that Rule 804 did not permit introduction of this testimony , because it was not sufficiently against Floyd's interests : 'The statements attributed to Floyd did not constitute an admission of a crime . In and of themselves they did not even 'tend to subject' Floyd to criminal liability . At most , they cast suspicion on Floyd when paired with other information that may or may not have been known to Floyd.' Id . We concluded by reiterating the deference we extend to trial courts in determining such debatable questions of admissibility : 'Trial judges 'are close to the facts and far better able to evaluate the various circumstances than an appellate court , [ and ] therefore must be given wide discretion to examine a particular statement to determine whether all or part of it should be admitted.'' Id . at 879 ) . More recently , in Camm v. State , the defendant wished to present statements made by Charles Boney , whom the defendant asserted was the sole perpetrator of the triple murder in question , rather than a co-conspirator . 908 N.E.2d 215 , 220 . Boney's statements sought to be introduced were : in response to a private investigator's hypothetical scenario , Boney stated that 'if physical evidence of Boney's presence at the scene of the killings was found , it would be 'pretty obvious' he was there and involved' ; and Boney told a friend that 'he had three bodies on his conscience , and that one more wouldn't matter.' Id . at 232 . We affirmed the trial court's exclusion of this testimony as not falling within the Rule 804 hearsay exception , finding 'there is nothing that Boney is alleged to have said to the defendant's investigator or to his friend that constituted an admission of a crime or tended to subject [ Boney ] to criminal liability.' Id . . In both Jervis and Camm , the declarants' statements sought to be admitted were vague and subject to interpretation . Here , we have no such ambiguity : Allen gave Beamon a precise account of his altercation with Beasley , and stated in no uncertain terms that he shot Beasley in the face . Even if Allen believed the shooting was justified as a matter of self-defense , it does not necessarily follow that Allen believed there was no possibility of future civil or criminal liability for the act . Beasley opposes this position by likening Allen's statements to telling someone you 'drove home drunk last night , ' in support of his assertion that 'trivial 'confessions' of criminal conduct' should not be rendered admissible hearsay under Rule 804 . Appellant's Br . at 12 . We can not agree that the act of shooting a fellow human being in the face qualifies as 'trivial.' Rather , we find the trial court could have reasonably determined that admitting to such a violent act would have 'so great a tendency . . . to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability' that it was admissible hearsay under Rule 804 . Beasley also contends that Allen's statements to Beamon do not satisfy the exception because Allen expected Beamon to 'keep his confidences , ' and thus Allen did not believe the statements would expose him to criminal liability . Appellant's Br . at 11 . A slight change to the facts demonstrates why this argument is unavailing'had Beasley named Allen as his shooter when speaking with police , there would have been at least a minimal investigation of Allen , as demonstrated by the investigation of Beasley's gunshot wound after he went to the hospital . It is not a stretch to presume police would have questioned those whom Allen had contact with the day after the shooting , including Beamon . Thus Beamon would have been put in the position of either lying to the police or revealing what Allen told him , which could have been incriminating despite Allen's claim of self-defense . In short , Allen's statements to Beamon rendered Beamon a witness against Allen should Allen be prosecuted for Beasley's shooting , which is sufficient for those statements to qualify as being against Allen's interests for purposes of a Rule 804 hearsay exception . Beasley also contends that Beamon's testimony was inherently unreliable , because at best the trauma of the shooting could have impacted Beamon's memory , and at worst , the personal and familial relationship between Allen and Beamon gave Beamon a motive to fabricate his testimony regarding Allen's report of the shooting . Even if this were so , there is sufficient other corroborating evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination that Allen's statements to Beamon'and Beamon's related testimony'were reliable . First and most significantly , Beasley actually went to the hospital with a gunshot wound to the face on the night of August 2 . This begs the question : how could Allen have known about Beasley's injury if he was not involved ? The record is devoid of any evidence that this shooting was made public , or of any witness to Beasley's shooting who might have informed Allen it had occurred prior to Allen's conversation with Beasley the next day . Thus the trial court could have reasonably determined that Allen had firsthand knowledge of the event , lending credibility to Allen's statements to Beamon . Beasley counters this point by noting he did not report Allen as the shooter , even though Beasley was well aware of Allen's identity . There are , however , a number of potential reasons for this omission , the most obvious being that accepting Allen's account as true , Beasley was shot with his own gun , and Beasley's very possession of that gun constituted a crime . 4 Beasley therefore could not reveal Allen as his shooter without also revealing his own criminal activity . Moreover , if Beasley truly did plan to dispatch Allen the following day , there would be no reason to reveal Allen's identity to the police'indeed , telling police that Allen had shot him might have resulted in Allen being incarcerated , which would defeat such a plan . Finally , police found no evidence of the shooting at the location where Beasley claimed it had occurred , and thus the trial court could have reasonably determined that Beasley was being less than forthright in his version of events . Second , police arrived at the hospital at approximately 8:30 p.m. the night Beasley was shot , and Allen thus could have been the shooter , sinceWilliams testified she left Allen sometime after 5:00 p.m. and picked him up again between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. At trial , Beasley alluded to contradictory deposition testimony , where Williams agreed that she had been with Allen from 5:00 p.m. onwards on August 2 , to which Williams responded , 'I must have been confused . . . .' Tr . at 684 . Which account to credit was , however , within the province of the factfinder , and on appeal we construe the evidence in the manner most consistent with the trial court's judgment regarding the admissibility of evidence . See Pierce , 29 N.E.3d at 1264 . Third , Williams and Allen stayed at a hotel on the night of August 2 even though both had fixed housing nearby , and they checked in under Williams's name . These circumstances support the inference that Allen did not want to be easily located that night , either by police or by Beasley . Moreover , when coupled with the evidence of Allen's home being ransacked , Allen's decision to stay at a hotel supports the inference that Allen had cause to'and actually did'fear for his life , which is consistent with Allen's account to Beamon of his violent altercation with Beasley and his fear of retaliation . Although this corroborating evidence is not strictly required by our Rule 804,5 it certainly supports the trial court's determination that Beamon's hearsay testimony was reliable , which 'is , after all , the ultimate justification for admission of statements against interest.' Jarvis , 679 N.E.2d at 879 . We thus find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these hearsay statements under Rule 804 . For the foregoing reasons , we affirm the admission of Gerald Beamon's testimony regarding James Allen's recount of his altercation with Leandrew Beasley , as such statements fell within the hearsay exception of Indiana Evidence Rule 804 . In all other respects , we summarily affirm the holding of our Court of Appeals below . R.E . appealed the trial court's issuance of a protective order against her in favor of M.S . The Court of Appeals affirmed in a memorandum decision . Among other things , R.E . requested that the Court of Appeals redact her full name from its decision , and identify her by initials only . The Court of Appeals denied her requests . R.E . seeks transfer , which we now grant for the purpose of substituting R.E.'s name with her initials in our opinion . In all other respects we summarily affirm the Court of Appeals' decision . See Ind . Appellate Rule 58 . Plaintiff Randy Thornton brought multiple claims against several defendants arising out of his incarceration for a probation violation that allegedly occurred after his term of probation had expired . The trial court dismissed his claims against all defendants . The Court of Appeals affirmed in a memorandum decision . Thornton v. State of Indiana , No . 49A02-1409-PL-662 . Thornton seeks transfer , contending only that his claim against four individual probation officers under 42 U.S.C . _ 1983 was improperly dismissed . The Defendants moved to dismiss Thornton's _ 1983 claim pursuant to Indiana Trial Rule 12 , contending Thornton failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because his claim was barred by the statute of limitations . . The trial court summarily granted the Defendants' motion . Affirming that decision , the Court of Appeals did not address the parties' arguments for and against dismissal , but sua sponte determined , 'Thornton has wholly failed to state a claim against [ the Defendants ] even assuming his claims were timely filed.' Thornton , No . 49A02-1409-PL-662 , slip op . at 6 . 'A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim tests the legal sufficiency of the claim , not the facts supporting it.' Kitchell v. Franklin , 997 N.E.2d 1020 , 1025 . When ruling on a motion to dismiss , the court must 'view the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party , with every reasonable inference construed in the non-movant's favor.' Id . We review a trial court's grant or denial of a Trial Rule 12 motion de novo . Id . We will not affirm such a dismissal 'unless it is apparent that the facts alleged in the challenged pleading are incapable of supporting relief under any set of circumstances.' City of E. Chicago , Indiana v. E. Chicago Second Century , Inc. , 908 N.E.2d 611 , 617 . Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code is a federal statute which 'provides a civil remedy against any 'person' who , under color of state law , subjects a 'citizen of the United States' to the 'deprivation of any rights , privileges , or immunities' secured by the federal Constitution or federal laws.' Bayh v. Sonnenburg , 573 N.E.2d 398 , 402 . 'By the plain terms of _ 1983 , two'and only two'allegations are required in order to state a cause of action under that statute.' Gomez v. Toledo , 446 U.S. 635 , 640 . A _ 1983 claim need only allege that 'some person has deprived [ the claimant ] of a federal right' and that person 'acted under color of state or territorial law.' Id . See In re Tina T. , 579 N.E.2d 48 , 62 ) ) . Among other things , Thornton's complaint alleged the Defendants , Marion County probation officials , took actions which constituted 'unconstitutional deprivations of liberty and violations of due process.' . Thornton's complaint stated a claim for relief under _ 1983 . In the lower courts , Defendants offered two alternative arguments in support of dismissal : Thornton's claim was filed after the statute of limitations expired ; and the Defendants are entitled to quasi-judicial immunity . We may affirm a trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss if it is sustainable on any basis in the record . See City of New Haven v. Reichhart , 748 N.E.2d 374 , 378 ) . We note the Defendants do not reassert their statute of limitations argument on transfer , and , regardless , we find the argument unpersuasive . As to quasi-judicial immunity , such a determination requires an inquiry into 'the nature of the function performed , not the identity of the person who performed it.' Mendenhall v. City of Indianapolis , 717 N.E.2d 1218 , 1226 ) , trans . denied . The record before us is insufficient to permit such an inquiry . We find the trial court erred when it determined Thornton's complaint did not state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C . _ 1983 against the individually-named probation officers . Accordingly , we grant transfer and reverse dismissal of Thornton's _ 1983 claim against the Defendants and remand to the trial court for further proceedings . In doing so , we express no opinion on the merits of Thornton's claim . In all other respects we summarily affirm the Court of Appeals' decision . See Ind . Appellate Rule 58 . Today this Court holds that the promissory note in the present case does not satisfy the requirement of 'payment' under the disputed employment contract . This issue arose when James Armour's employment contract with AM General entitled him to payment of a long-term incentive plan . When Armour retired in early 2012 , he was to receive a lump sum LTIP payment on or about January 20 , 2012 . Instead , Armour started receiving quarterly installment payments in the form of checks , which Armour accepted . However , in December of 2012 , AM General attempted to make the final installment payment with a subordinate promissory note . The language within the Note provided that acceptance would function to fully release AM General from its obligations under the LTIP provision of the Employment Agreement . It also contained various other conditions on payment and transferability . Armour promptly rejected the Note , requesting full payment . This case reaches us today based upon Armour's claim that the Note did not constitute payment under the Employment Agreement . We agree . The term 'pay' within the Employment Agreement obligated AM General to make the LTIP payment to Armour in cash or a cash equivalent . The Note tendered to Armour was merely a conditional promise to pay and can not constitute payment where no provision within the Employment Agreement permits payment in the form of a subordinate promissory note . As such , AM General breached the Employment Agreement when it failed to pay Armour the LTIP amounts when due . We affirm the trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of Armour , including the award of pre-judgment interest . On November 14 , 2007 , James Armour entered into an employment contract with AM General , LLC . Under that contract , AM General 'shall pay to [ Armour ] ' an annual salary , an annual bonus , and a long-term incentive plan . . Under the Employment Agreement , the LTIP payment was to be made 'at the time bonus payments under Section 2 are paid to other employees of [ AM General ] with respect to the Employer's 2011 fiscal year.' On or about January 2 , 2012 , Armour retired as President , CEO , and Chairman of AM General . However , on or about January 20 , 2012 , when Armour and other AM General employees received their 2011 fiscal year bonuses , Armour did not receive his LTIP payment . Rather , Armour began receiving his LTIP payment in installment checks . The first payment was made by check dated March 14 , 2012 . The second payment was made by check dated May 15 , 2012 . The third payment was made by check dated August 15 , 2012 . Armour accepted each of the three installment payments . Then , Armour received a promissory note from AM General dated December 14 , 2012 . The Note promised to pay Armour the remaining amount owed under the LTIP provision of his Employment Agreement . The Note provided , 'in accepting delivery of this Note , [ the Holder ] acknowledges that delivery of this Note satisfies all obligations of the Company under [ the LTIP provision ] of the Employment Agreement.' Full payment of the Note was not due until 2015 , the Note was unsecured , transferable only upon certain conditions , and subordinate to other debts owed by AM General . On December 20 , 2012 , Armour's attorney responded to the receipt of the Note , and expressly refused to accept the Note as payment under the Employment Agreement . The letter demanded payment of all of the amounts owed to Armour under the Employment Agreement . In response , AM General filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that AM General had not breached the LTIP portion of its Employment Agreement with Armour . AM General expressed its belief that payment via the Note satisfied its obligations under the Employment Agreement and 'was in the best interests [ sic ] of AM General.' Armour counter-claimed , asserting that AM General breached the Employment Agreement when it failed to pay Armour the full LTIP payment when it was due in early 2012 . Armour also asserted that AM General's attempt to satisfy its obligation to pay the remaining portion of the LTIP payment with a promissory note breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing . Subsequently , Armour sought summary judgment . On June 27 , 2013 , a hearing was held on the summary judgment motion , and the trial court ultimately entered an order in favor of Armour . The trial court concluded that the plain meaning of 'pay' or 'payment' is 'to exchange cash or the cash equivalent for goods or services.' The trial court concluded that the Note tendered to Armour can not be construed as cash or its equivalent . As such , AM General breached the Employment Agreement by failing to timely pay the LTIP in cash and by Armour not accepting the Note as a substitute for payment . AM General was ordered to pay the remaining balance owed to Armour , in addition to pre-judgment interest calculated from January 20 , 2012 , through the date of judgment . A split Court of Appeals reversed the trial court , finding a genuine issue of material fact in regards to how 'payment' could be made under the LTIP provision of the Employment Agreement . AM General , LLC v. Armour , 27 N.E.2d 817 , 821 . Chief Judge Vaidik dissented , agreeing with the trial court that the term 'pay' within the Employment Agreement required payment to be in the form of cash or its equivalent , and a promissory note can not satisfy AM General's obligation to pay absent an express agreement . Id . at 821 . Chief Judge Vaidik would have affirmed summary judgment in favor of Armour . Id . at 824 . Upon Armour's petition , this Court granted transfer , thereby vacating the opinion of the Court of Appeals . Appellate Rule 58 ; AM General , LLC v. Armour , 34 N.E.3d 250 . We now affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Armour and hold that the Note , as a matter of law , did not constitute payment under the Employment Agreement . As such , AM General breached its Employment Agreement with Armour . We also decline to find any genuine issue of material fact in relation to the calculation of pre-judgment interest and affirm the trial court's award of pre-judgment interest . Orders for summary judgment are reviewed de novo , and require this Court to apply the same standard of review that is applied by the trial court . Indiana Restorative Dentistry , P.C . v. Laven Ins . Agency , Inc. , 27 N.E.3d 260 , 264 ) . The movant must demonstrate that 'the designated evidence raises no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' Id . Upon this showing , the nonmoving party then has the burden to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact . Id . All reasonable inferences will be construed in favor of the nonmoving party . Id . In the present case , Armour and AM General dispute whether the term 'pay' within the Employment Agreement is ambiguous , and whether an ambiguity in relation to the acceptable form of payment requires consideration of extrinsic evidence . Alternatively , AM General asserts that even if payment , as a matter of law , means cash or its equivalent , the designated evidence creates a genuine issue of fact that the Note tendered to Armour is a cash equivalent , and payment via the Note satisfied AM General's obligation to pay the remaining LTIP amount under the Employment Agreement . In the present case , the rules of contract construction govern the resolution of the disputed issue . The primary rule of construction first requires giving the words of the contract their plain and ordinary meaning . Ryan v. Ryan , 972 N.E.2d 359 , 364 . 'Clear and unambiguous terms in the contract are deemed conclusive , and when they are present we will not construe or look to extrinsic evidence , but will merely apply the contractual provisions.' Id . Under Indiana precedent , the term 'pay' or 'payment' has a plain legal meaning that can be applied in the present case . As such , we conclude that under the Employment Agreement , AM General was required to make the LTIP payments in cash or its equivalent . Because our analysis also demonstrates that the promissory Note tendered to , but rejected by , Armour was not the equivalent to a cash payment , AM General breached the Employment Agreement and Armour was entitled to summary judgment . Furthermore , the trial court did not err by ordering pre-judgment interest to be calculated from the date payment was due under the Employment Agreement . Armour argues that the form of payment due under the Employment Agreement presents a question of law , not fact . Moreover , Armour contends that no genuine issue of material fact was created based upon an affidavit submitted by the Vice President of Human Resources at AM General , which provided that , 'unlike bonus payments , which the contract expressly stated must be paid in cash , the contract did not address the issue of how LTIP payments were to be made.' AM General contends , among other things , that because the form of payment was not specified in the Employment Agreement , the term 'pay' was ambiguous and subject to interpretation based upon extrinsic evidence , such as the Redemption Agreement . The Redemption Agreement was executed on the same day as the Employment Agreement and did allow for specified payments to be made with a subordinate note under some circumstances . First and foremost , we agree with Armour that the meaning of 'pay' within the Employment Agreement presents a question of law . If ambiguity in a contract 'arises because of the language used in the contract and not because of extrinsic facts then its construction is purely a question of law to be determined by the trial court.' First Federal Sav . Bank of Indiana v. Key Markets , Inc. , 559 N.E.2d 600 , 604 ; See also Holiday Hospitality Franchising , Inc. v. AMCO Insurance Co. , 983 N.E.2d 574 , 577 . In the present case , only the meaning of the word 'pay' is disputed , which 'has a well-understood meaning , and in legal contemplation payment is the discharge in money or its equivalent of an obligation or debt owing by one person to another.' Egbert v. Egbert , 235 Ind . 405 , 418 , 132 N.E.2d 910 , 917 . Additionally , 'the law declares that payment shall be made in money , unless there is an enforceable contract providing for payment in something of value other than money.' Vansickle v. Ferguson , 122 Ind . 450 , 23 N.E . 858 . The affidavit submitted by AM General only demonstrates that the form of payment was not specified in the Employment Agreement . However , as stated above , where the form of payment is not specified , Indiana law mandates that either cash or its equivalent is required . The parties do not dispute that AM General attempted to 'pay' Armour with a promissory note , nor do they dispute that various conditions were placed upon the receipt of payment under the terms of the Note . Thus , the primary issue is whether the Note was a cash equivalent , which would be necessary to satisfy AM General's contractual obligation to pay Armour the LTIP amounts . By looking to the Note itself , it is apparent that the Note is not the equivalent to cash . Rather , various limitations are placed upon receiving payment of the principal amount , which makes the Note starkly distinguishable from a cash payment . First , the principal of the Note was not due until three years after the LTIP payments were due under the Employment Agreement . Second , the Note was unsecured and subordinate to large bank debts that AM General owed . Finally , the Note could only be transferred under specific conditions . Thus , these conditions create the possibility that Armour may never receive actual payment , and even if payment were obtained , it would be delayed years beyond when it was due under the Employment Agreement . Moreover , the very definition of a promissory note demonstrates that the Note itself is not payment , but is merely a promise to pay some amount in the future . See Black's Law Dictionary 9th Ed. , p.1162 . Thus , AM General's tender of the Note , while it was a promise to pay , was not 'payment' as demanded by the Employment Agreement . AM General accurately recites that summary judgment may 'be precluded by as little as a non-movant's mere designation of a self-serving affidavit.' Hughley v. State , 15 N.E.3d 1000 , 1003 . However , upon review of Hughley , it is clear that a self-serving affidavit may only preclude summary judgment when it establishes that material facts are in dispute , and not when an affidavit merely disputes a legal issue . Here , AM General designated an affidavit which provided that the form of payment under the Employment Agreement was not specified . Yet , the affidavit in Hughley is distinguishable from that submitted by AM General because the affidavit in Hughley went to a disputed issue of fact . In Hughley , the parties disputed what property may be subject to forfeiture , which required the parties to present evidence of how the property was used . Id . at 1004 . Because the parties offered affidavits which supported conflicting inferences on how the property was used , the 'trier of fact [ was ] required to resolve the parties' differing accounts of the truth.' Id . . The use of property was a disputed issue of fact . Nothing within the language of Hughley indicates a change to the established understanding that when addressing a motion for summary judgment , ' [ t ] he averment of facts which create only an issue of law , rather than an issue of fact , will not defeat the motion.' Babchuck v. Heinold Elevator , Co. , 246 N.E.2d 211 , 216 . The language within Hughley even maintains the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact by reiterating that ' [ s ] ummary judgment 'is a desirable tool to allow the trial court to dispose of cases where only legal issues exist.'' Hughley , 15 N.E.3d at 1003 ) . In the present case , the affidavit only solidifies what is apparent from the face of the Employment Agreement and what the parties already agree ; the Employment Agreement does not specify a particular form in which the LTIP payments are to be made . To the extent that AM General contends that the affidavit creates a genuine issue as to the permissible form of payment of the LTIP , the affidavit would only go to a legal issue , which can properly be decided on summary judgment . As explained above , the word pay is unambiguous and requires payment to be made in cash or its equivalent . All of the facts necessary to determine whether the Note is the equivalent to a cash payment is represented on the face of the Note . The parties do not dispute that the Note was not due until three years after it was delivered , was unsecured and subordinate to other AM General debts , and had limitations placed upon transfer.2 As such , granting summary judgment in this context does not run contrary to our holding in Hughley because the affidavit submitted by AM General did not create a genuine issue of material fact , as the affidavits in Hughley did . 'When a court finds a contract to be clear in its terms and the intentions of the parties apparent , the court will require the parties to perform consistently with the bargain they made.' Key Markets , Inc. , 559 N.E.2d at 604 . Because the promissory Note did not constitute 'payment' under Armour's Employment Agreement , AM General breached its contract with Armour . Accordingly , we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Armour . AM General also contends that there was a genuine issue of material fact about the starting date for calculating the pre-judgment interest . The trial court ordered pre-judgment interest based upon a January 20 , 2012 start date , which was the date the LTIP payment was due under the Employment Agreement . Moreover , the trial court relied upon the interest calculations as submitted by AM General's Vice President of Human Resources . The parties do not dispute that under the Employment Agreement , the LTIP payment was due on or about January 20 , 2012 . Rather , AM General argues that Armour made an oral agreement in December 2011 to accept LTIP payments in quarterly installments throughout 2012 and that his acceptance of three installment checks after the January contract deadline served to ratify the parties modified agreement that the LTIP payments were due 'over the course of 2012.' Due to this , AM General argues that pre-judgment interest should be calculated from December 31 , 2012 , not January 20 , 2012 . Again , we disagree with AM General's contention that there is a genuine issue of material fact in relation to the start date for calculating pre-judgment interest . First , the Employment Agreement specifically provided that it could 'not be modified except by a writing signed by the parties hereto.' AM General does not contend that there was ever a writing upon which Armour agreed to accept LTIP payments as installments throughout 2012 . Rather , AM General asserts that a phone call was made to Armour in December 2011 'to explain to Mr. Armour the current circumstances at AM General and why it was in AM General's best interest to make the 2012 LTIP payments in quarterly installments.' Because Armour 'did not reject the quarterly installment program , ' AM General believed that Armour had agreed to the program . Armor contends that during that phone conversation he told AM General that it 'did not have the right to defer making the LTIP payment . . . .' Thus , while there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether an oral agreement was ever made , summary judgment would still be appropriate if the alleged oral modification is otherwise invalid . Even if we presume that the oral agreement occurred as AM General contends and that the oral modification could supersede the contractual provision requiring all modifications to be in writing,3 'the modification of a contract , because it is also a contract , requires all of the requisite elements of a contract.' City of Indianapolis v. Twin Lakes Enterprises , Inc. , 568 N.E.2d 1073 , 1085 . Thus , a modification must have adequate consideration . Hinkel v. Sataria Distribution and Packaging , Inc. , 920 N.E.2d 766 , 770 . 'Consideration consist of either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee.' Id . 'In other words , consideration requires a bargained-for exchange.' Id . Here , even if the oral agreement occurred as AM General contends , Armour received nothing in exchange for AM General making the LTIP payments in four installments , rather than as a lump sum payment on January 20 , 2012 . Under the alleged modification , AM General only agreed to do what it already had an obligation to do under the existing Employment Agreement ; pay the full amount owed under the LTIP provision.4 See Seastrom , Inc. v. Amick Const . Co. , Inc. , 315 N.E.2d 431 , 433 . Accordingly , even if the oral agreement had occurred , it fails as a valid contract modification for lack of consideration . AM General also argues that Armour waived the argument that payment was due at the time specified in the Employment Agreement by accepting three installment payments . However , the express terms within the contract undercut this argument . The Employment Agreement provides that ' [ t ] he failure of either party to insist upon the strict performance of any of the terms , conditions , and provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of future compliance therewith , and said terms , conditions , and provision shall remain in full force and effect.' Where an employment contract contains such a clause , Indiana courts have upheld a finding that no waiver of contractual obligations have occurred . See Sallee v. Mason , 714 N.E.2d 757 , 762 . Armour did not relinquish his right to demand the LTIP payments at the time they were due under the Employment Agreement because he subsequently accepted three installment payments . Because any modification to the Employment Agreement regarding when the LTIP payments were due failed for lack of consideration , there is no genuine issue of fact regarding the trial court's determination that pre-judgment interest should be calculated from January 20 , 2012 . Moreover , since the trial court relied upon the affidavit and exhibits submitted by AM General in determining the amount of pre-judgment interests that should be awarded based upon the January 20 , 2012 start date , we affirm the trial court's award of pre-judgment interest . AM General failed to satisfy its obligation under the Employment Agreement LTIP provision when it offered Armour a subordinate promissory note as payment . As a matter of law , payment under the contract required the LTIP to be paid in cash or a cash equivalent . The various conditions placed upon the Note demonstrates that the Note was not a cash equivalent . We affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Armour , awarding him the remaining portion of his LTIP payments . We also affirm the trial court's order awarding Armour pre-judgment interest calculated from January 20 , 2012 , the time at which the LTIP payment was due under the Employment Agreement .  </body>
